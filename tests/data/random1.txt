TI Preliminary observations on effects of using different stocking rates of
   meat goats to control understory vegetation in longleaf pine stands
SO AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB The use of goats for clearing longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) stand undergrowths has potential as an alternative tool to prescribed burning. Objectives of the experiment were to determine the effects of using different stocking rates of meat goats on understory plant biomass height and quantity, understory crown cover density, animal productivity, soil characteristics and damage to pine trees. A 4.86 ha of 8-9 years old longleaf pine stands with 1112 trees/ha was divided into twelve 0.40 ha at Tuskegee, AL. The understudy vegetation contained many volunteer tree species with Broomsedge (Andropogon virginicus L.) being the predominant grass cover. Fifty-four mature Kiko wether goats (initial BW = 48.5 +/- 2.5 kg) were allocated randomly to four treatments (0, 3, 6, 9 goats/0.4 ha) with three replications per treatment for 83 days in 2013 according to a completely randomized block design. The data was analyzed using the GLM procedure of SAS. The tree damage was monitored. Results showed that both initial and the final soil bulk density and soil compaction, plant biomass heights and quantity were not significantly different (P > 0.05) among treatments. Average daily BW gains were not significantly different (P = 0.76) but daily gains were close to zero. The combined final crown cover density percent at 2.0 m decreased linearly (P < 0.05) with increasing stocking rates. The tree damage was minimal even at the highest stocking rates. The results suggest that goats have potential to manage understory vegetation under longleaf pines.

TI Soil quality differences in a row-crop watershed with agroforestry and
   grass buffers
SO AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB Agroforestry buffers are believed to enhance soil quality parameters in agricultural landscapes. Soil enzyme activities, water stable aggregates (WSA), soil organic carbon (SOC), and total nitrogen (N) have been identified as good indices of soil quality. The objective of this study was to quantify soil quality differences among agroforestry buffer (AGF), grass waterway (GWW), grass buffer (GB), and row crop (RC) areas and distance from the tree base on corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean (Glycine max L.) watershed. Soil samples from AGF at 0, 30, 60, 90 cm distances from the tree base, and from AGF, GWW, GB, and RC areas were collected from summit, shoulder, and foot-slope landscape positions at the paired watershed study near Novelty, MO. Soil enzyme activity, WSA, soil C, and N were determined and data were analyzed statistically. The highest SOC and N percentages were found in AGF and the lowest in RC. beta-Glucosidase activity was not significantly different among AGF, GWW, and RC. beta-Glucosaminidase and dehydrogenase activities were significantly lower in RC treatment than all other treatments. Fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolase activity was not significant among all treatments. WSA percentage was significantly higher in GWW and AGF as compared to others. Landscape position was not significantly different for all measured soil quality parameters. beta-Glucosidase, beta-glucosaminidase activities, WSA, and soil N did not differ significantly with distance from the tree base. SOC and FDA hydrolase activity were significantly lower at the tree base. Results imply that permanent vegetation has improved the soil quality by enhancing soil microbial activity and organic matter accumulation, thereby contribute positively to watershed restoration.

TI Water infiltration and soil water content in claypan soils influenced by
   agroforestry and grass buffers compared to row crop management
SO AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB Agroforestry buffers have recently been introduced in temperate regions to enhance conservation of soil and water resources in row crop management. The effects of agroforestry and grass-legume buffers on in situ water infiltration relative to row crop management (RC) were assessed for a claypan soil in northeastern Missouri, USA. Infiltration rates were observed in early June in 2014 and 2015 for watersheds under corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) management; these watersheds had agroforestry buffers (AGB) or grass buffers (GB). The dominant soil for the watersheds was Putnam silt loam (fine, smectitic, mesic Vertic Albaqualf). The watersheds were in no-till management and established in 1991 with agroforestry buffers and GBs implemented in 1997. Agroforestry buffers, 4.5 m wide and 36.5 m apart, consisted of redtop (Agrostis gigantean Roth), brome (Bromus spp.), and birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.) with pin oak (Quercus palustris Menchh.), swamp white oak (Q. bicolor Willd.), and bur oak (Q. macrocarpa Michx.) trees. GBs consisted of redtop, brome, and birdsfoot trefoil. Significant differences were found among the treatments in 2014 for the sorptivity parameter for the fitted infiltration equations with the highest values for agroforestry buffers. Significantly higher saturated hydraulic conductivity values were found for the buffer treatments in 2015. Soil water content measurements were assessed over time for years 2010 and 2011 with sensors at 5, 10, 20 and 40 cm depths for the agroforestry buffer and RC areas. Water content decreased more rapidly during the summer season within agroforestry buffers relative to RC areas; however, water infiltration was higher within agroforestry buffers during the recharge period.

TI Optimizing resource distribution and crop productivity in hedgerow
   intercropping by manipulating tree arrangement
SO AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB The potential of tree arrangement in optimizing radiation and soil water distribution and crop yield of hedgerow intercropping systems was investigated using a Jatropha curcas-Pennisetum clandestinum (kikuyu) system (Ukulinga, South Africa). Treatments (1110 t ha(-1)) of Jatropha-only (JO), single-row Jatropha and kikuyu (SR), and double-row Jatropha and kikuyu (DR) were used. Treatments had asymmetrical radiation distribution across tree-crop (T-C) interfaces and different radiation interception by trees (JO: 27 %, SR: 11 %, DR: 8 %). Soil water varied among treatments and was asymmetrically distributed showing no consistent trend towards trees. Evapotranspiration was higher (p < 0.05) in SR than DR (13-65 %) and JO (16-37 %) for most part of the season. Estimated fine tree roots distribution was symmetrical in DR but not JO and SR. Total roots in SR were concentrated in the top 0.2 m (91 %) and beneath tree row (30 %), and varied inconsistently with distance from trees. Grass yields increased farther from tree rows and were higher in SR (8.7 t ha(-1) in 2006-2007; 4.3 t ha(-1) in 2007-2008) than DR (by < 9 %). Radiation use efficiency of kikuyu (0.14-0.44 g MJ(-1)) also increased with distance from trees but irradiance correlated with grass yields poorly (R-2 < 0.32) despite high rainfall and no nutrient limitation. Considering total productivity and evapotranspiration, DR was better tree arrangement than SR. Water availability dictated T-C interactions and intercrop yield more than radiation. It was possible to optimize radiation and water distribution and intercrop growth by manipulating tree arrangement without changing density.

TI A model for estimating windbreak carbon within COMET-Farm (TM)
SO AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB Agroforestry as a land management practice presents a method for partially offsetting greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural land. Of all agroforestry practices in the United States, windbreaks in particular are used throughout the United States providing a useful starting point for deriving a modelling system which could quantify the amount of carbon sequestered on U.S. agricultural land and provide for broad usability. We present our first approximation to this end by presenting a model that estimates current and future stocks within multiple carbon pools of windbreak systems such as live trees, the O horizon, downed woody debris and standing dead trees. In this article, we describe each modelled process driving carbon fluxes within carbon pools including novel windbreak tree growth and mortality models. Our model is generalized by region and species group allowing us to run scenarios for any common tree species in any location within the contiguous United States. Integrated into the agricultural greenhouse gas accounting tool, COMET-Farm (TM), the windbreak component gives landowners and land managers power to view agroforestry systems in the same context as agricultural operations and provides an alternative to intensive biomass inventories.

TI Estimating carbon storage in windbreak trees on US agricultural lands
SO AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB Assessing carbon (C) capture and storage potential by the agroforestry practice of windbreaks has been limited. This is due, in part, to a lack of suitable data and associated models for estimating tree biomass and C for species growing under more open-grown conditions such as windbreaks in the Central Plains region of the United States (U.S.). We evaluated 15 allometric models using destructively sampled Pinus ponderosa (Lawson & C. Lawson) data from field windbreaks in Nebraska and Montana. Several goodness-of-fit metrics were used to select the optimal model. The Jenkins' et al. model was then used to estimate biomass for 16 tree species in windbreaks projected over a 50 year time horizon in nine continental U.S. regions. Carbon storage potential in the windbreak scenarios ranged from 1.07 +/- 0.21 to 3.84 +/- 0.04 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) for conifer species and from 0.99 +/- 0.16 to 13.6 +/- 7.72 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) for broadleaved deciduous species during the 50 year period. Estimated mean C storage potentials across species and regions were 2.45 +/- 0.42 and 4.39 +/- 1.74 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) for conifer and broadleaved deciduous species, respectively. Such information enhances our capacity to better predict the C sequestration potential of windbreaks associated with whole farm/ranch operations in the U.S.

TI Avian diversity in a temperate tree-based intercropping system from
   inception to now
SO AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB Migratory bird populations in North America have been declining over the last several decades, largely due to habitat loss and forest cover fragmentation in both their summer breeding ranges and overwintering territories. Tree-based intercropping (TBI), which is a land-use system incorporating trees with agricultural crops on the same unit of land, is an alternative to conventional agriculture that provisions many ecological and environmental benefits in conjunction with agricultural production. This study seeks to assess the contributions of temperate TBI systems on avian biodiversity, and to quantify these changes as they develop in time. Standard bird monitoring protocols were used to examine avian communities in a TBI system at the University of Guelph's Agroforestry Research Site in 2014 and compared to a similar study completed by Williams et al. in 1995 at the same site. The TBI system surveys were then compared to present (2014) and past (1995) avian communities living in other nearby agro-ecosystems including an abandoned field, conventional monocrop field, a willow plantation and a mature woodlot. The avian species richness and diversity at the TBI site was higher in 2014 (32 species; diversity index of 2.9) than in 1995 (17 species; diversity index of 2.2). Among land-use types, avian species richness was highest at the TBI site in both 2014 (32 species vs. 26, 24, 21, and 15) and 1995 (17 species vs. 7 and 4). The results of this study suggest that TBI systems may help to maintain and even enhance avian diversity in North America.

TI Using microsatellite DNA to determine whether American Hazelnut Clumps
   are multiclonal
SO AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB We have been selecting high yielding American hazelnut (Corylus americana) from wild populations. Because hazelnuts tend to have a spreading growth form, it was unclear whether phenotypic variation among the individual stems of a clump was due to multiple genotypes which had grown together. This would significantly complicate selection. In order to determine if these bushes were single genotypes, we collected leaf samples from the four cardinal directions from each of 23 high producing stems. These were analyzed for 4-6 microsatellite loci. We determined that of the 23 selections, 5 were composed of more than one genotype. Additionally, one clump had one allele on one direction that was different (likely allele dropout from a heterozygote where one allele did not amplify correctly). Overall, the majority of clumps (78 %) were composed of a single genotype. This suggests that selecting at the level of "clump" is viable. Additionally, we noticed that within our selection sites, certain plants seemed to function only as males (produced male catkins but seldom produced female flowers) while others produced copious female flowers and subsequently nuts. Within one site, we selected 20 hazelnuts with both male and female flowers and 19 with only male flowers. Using the same microsatellite techniques for 10 loci, we assessed whether there were obvious genetic differences between these types of plants. Overall, there was no difference between plants that bore female flowers and those that did not. Microsatellite DNA techniques are becoming a more useful tool for selection of potential agroforestry crops from wild populations.

TI Shark conservation and management policy: a review and primer for
   non-specialists
SO ANIMAL CONSERVATION
AB There is increasing concern for the conservation of sharks among scientists, environmental conservation advocates, and the interested public, but misunderstanding among policy non-specialists about which conservation and management policies are available, and which might work best for certainsituations, persists. Here we present a review of fisheries management and conservation literature relating to sharks. Policies are broadly divided into target-based policies that aim for sustainable fisheries exploitation (e.g. fisheries quotas) and limit-based policies that aim to prevent all fisheries exploitation of entire taxa (e.g. marine reserves). A list of the pros and cons of each policy is included, as is a decision tree to aid in selection of the most appropriate policy. Our goal is that this paper will allow policy non-specialists, including scientists without policy training, environmental activists, andconcerned citizens, to make informed decisions when advocating for shark conservation.

TI A differential privacy protection scheme for sensitive big data in body
   sensor networks
SO ANNALS OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS
AB As a special kind of application of wireless sensor networks, body sensor networks (BSNs) have broad application perspectives in health caring. Big data acquired from BSNs usually contain sensitive information, such as physical condition, location information, and so on, which is compulsory to be appropriately protected. However, previous methods overlooked the privacy protection issue, leading to privacy violation. In this paper, a differential privacy protection scheme for sensitive big data in BSNs is proposed. A tree structure is constructed to reduce errors and provide long range queries. Haar Wavelet transformation method is applied to convert histogram into a complete binary tree. At last, to verify the advantages of our scheme, several experiments are conducted to show the outperformed results. Experimental results demonstrate that the tree structure greatly reduces the calculation overheads which preserves differential privacy for users.

TI Performance evaluation of Enhanced Very Fast Decision Tree (EVFDT)
   mechanism for distributed denial-of-service attack detection in health
   care systems
SO ANNALS OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS
AB Securing cloud-assisted Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) environment by applying security mechanism that consumes less resources is still a challenging task. This research makes an attempt to address the same. One of the most prominent attacks in cloud-assisted WBAN is Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack that not only disrupts the communication but also diminishes the network bandwidth and capacity. This work is an extension of our previous research work in which an Enhanced Very Fast Decision Tree (EVFDT) was proposed which could detect DDoS attack successfully. However, in our previous work, the proposed algorithm is evaluated on the dataset generated by implementing LEACH protocol in NS-2. In this paper, a real-time cloud-assisted WBAN test bed is deployed to investigate the efficiency and accuracy of proposed EVFDT algorithm for real-time sensor network traffic. To evaluate the performance of proposed algorithm on real-time WBAN, four metrics are used including classification accuracy, time, memory, and computational cost. It was observed that EVFDT outperforms the existing algorithms by maintaining better results for these metrics even in the presence of extreme noise. Experimental results show that the EVFDT algorithm attains significantly high detection accuracy with less false alarm rate.

TI Is behavioural enrichment always a success? Comparing food presentation
   strategies in an insectivorous lizard (Plica plica)
SO APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE
AB Staggering food availability through a delivery device is a common way of providing behavioural enrichment as it is usually thought to increase the amount of natural behaviour due to the unpredictability of the food source. Tree-runner lizards (Plica plica) are a Neotropical, scansorial, insectivorous species. We provided these lizards with an enrichment device that slowly released insect prey and tested its effect on the activity and frequency of a number of behaviours in comparison with a scatter control (where prey items were broadcast in the enclosure; standard food presentation for captive insectivorous lizards) and a non-feeding control. Both types of food increased activity and counts of several behaviours in comparison with the non-feeding control. However, we found the provision of the behavioural enrichment device led to a significantly lower frequency of almost all analysed behaviours in comparison with scatter control trials, mainly in behaviours associated with activity (unsuccessful strikes (= unsuccessful capture of prey) (p = 0.004), locomotion (p = 0.004), alertness (p = 0.004) and the number of times a boundary in the enclosure was crossed ie. activity (p = <0.001)). The frequencies significantly increased in the enrichment trials (relative to the scatter control) were the number of successful strikes (=successful capture of prey; p = <0.001) and targeting prey (p = <0.001). There was no significant difference in latency to first strike (p = 0.24), duration of hunting activity (p = 0.83) or enclosure use (p = >0.05) between scatter and enriched trials. The relative success of the scatter feed in promoting activity and increasing hunting difficulty was likely partly due to the enclosure design, where the complex physical environment contributed to the difficultly in catching the prey. However, when the feeding duration and enclosure use was analysed there was no significant difference between the scatter control and enrichment trails. The results from this study highlight the importance of evaluating enrichment strategies, and the role of complex enclosure design in creating effective enrichment for insectivores, which can contribute to their welfare in captivity.

TI Regular Behaviours with Names
SO APPLIED CATEGORICAL STRUCTURES
AB Nominal sets provide a framework to study key notions of syntax and semantics such as fresh names, variable binding and alpha-equivalence on a conveniently abstract categorical level. Coalgebras for endofunctors on nominal sets model, e.g., various forms of automata with names as well as infinite terms with variable binding operators (such as lambda-abstraction). Here, we first study the behaviour of orbit-finite coalgebras for functors on nominal sets that lift some finitary set functor F. We provide sufficient conditions under which the rational fixpoint of , i.e. the collection of all behaviours of orbit-finite -coalgebras, is the lifting of the rational fixpoint of F. Second, we describe the rational fixpoint of the quotient functors: we introduce the notion of a sub-strength of an endofunctor on nominal sets, and we prove that for a functor G with a sub-strength the rational fixpoint of each quotient of G is a canonical quotient of the rational fixpoint of G. As applications, we obtain a concrete description of the rational fixpoint for functors arising from so-called binding signatures with exponentiation, such as those arising in coalgebraic models of infinitary lambda-terms and various flavours of automata.

TI A data mining approach for machine fault diagnosis based on associated
   frequency patterns
SO APPLIED INTELLIGENCE
AB Bearings play a crucial role in rotational machines and their failure is one of the foremost causes of breakdowns in rotary machinery. Their functionality is directly relevant to the operational performance, service life and efficiency of these machines. Therefore, bearing fault identification is very significant. The accuracy of fault or anomaly detection by the current techniques is not adequate. We propose a data mining-based framework for fault identification and anomaly detection from machine vibration data. In this framework, to capture the useful knowledge from the vibration data stream (VDS), we first pre-process the data using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to extract the frequency signature and then build a compact tree called SAFP-tree (sliding window associated frequency pattern tree), and propose a mining algorithm called SAFP. Our SAFP algorithm can mine associated frequency patterns (i.e., fault frequency signatures) in the current window of VDS and use them to identify faults in the bearing data. Finally, SAFP is further enhanced to SAFP-AD for anomaly detection by determining the normal behavior measure (NBM) from the extracted frequency patterns. The results show that our technique is very efficient in identifying faults and detecting anomalies over VDS and can be used for remote machine health diagnosis.

Decision trees constructed with existing approaches, however, tend to be huge and complex, and consequently are difficult to use in practical applications. In this study, we deal with the problem of tree complexity by allowing users to specify the number of leaf nodes, and then construct a decision tree that allows maximum classification accuracy with the given number of leaf nodes. A new algorithm, the Size Constrained Decision Tree (SCDT), is proposed with which to construct a decision tree, paying close attention on how to efficiently use the limited number of leaf nodes. Experimental results show that the SCDT method can successfully generate a simpler decision tree and offers better accuracy.

TI Verifying concurrent probabilistic systems using probabilistic-epistemic
   logic specifications
SO APPLIED INTELLIGENCE
AB In this paper, we address the problem of verifying probabilistic and epistemic properties in concurrent probabilistic systems expressed in PCTLK. PCTLK is an extension of the Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL) augmented with Knowledge (K). In fact, PCTLK enjoys two epistemic modalities K (i) for knowledge and for probabilistic knowledge. The approach presented for verifying PCTLK specifications in such concurrent systems is based on a transformation technique. More precisely, we convert PCTLK model checking into the problem of model checking Probabilistic Branching Time Logic (PBTL), which enjoys path quantifiers in the range of adversaries. We then prove that model checking a formula of PCTLK in concurrent probabilistic programs is PSPACE-complete. Furthermore, we represent models associated with PCTLK logic symbolically with Multi-Terminal Binary Decision Diagrams (MTBDDs), which are supported by the probabilistic model checker PRISM. Finally, an application, namely the NetBill online shopping payment protocol, and an example about synchronization illustrated through the dining philosophers problem are implemented with the MTBDD engine of this model checker to verify probabilistic epistemic properties and evaluate the practical complexity of this verification.

TI Seasonal and altitude effects on the structure of arthropod communities
   associated with Tillandsia violacea Baker (Bromeliaceae) in a temperate
   forest of Mexico
SO ARTHROPOD-PLANT INTERACTIONS
AB The canopy of forests has been considered "the last biotic frontier," and study of its elements is very important in explaining the global functionality in ecosystems. Epiphytic plants and arthropods are essential elements in canopy habitats, and their relationships have been studied in order to understand the high diversity in tropical forests. Nevertheless, there are few studies on this development in temperate forests. The arthropod community was studied during the rainy and dry seasons at two altitudes, and a total of 240 T. violacea plants of three sizes were collected from Abies religiosa and Quercus spp. host trees. A total of 163,043 arthropods were collected and about 200 morphospecies identified. The highest abundance was obtained during the dry season, while high diversity was found during the rainy season. There was a significant effect of plant size, host trees and collecting season on abundance and diversity, and there were seasonal variations in community composition. The community hosted on A. religiosa epiphytes showed higher abundance and density than that of Quercus.

TI Life-history parameters of Chrysoperla carnea s.l. fed on spontaneous
   plant species and insect honeydews: importance for conservation
   biological control
SO BIOCONTROL
AB Chrysoperla carnea s.l. (Stephens) (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) larvae are generalist predators feeding on many crop pests while adults feed on non-prey food. The knowledge about the nutritional suitability of non-prey food for adults in agroecosystems is crucial to establish conservation biological control strategies and is poorly known in olive groves, where C. carnea s.l. larvae prey on different pests. In this study, the effect of honeydew secreted by two hemipteran olive tree secondary pests and 11 plant species on the life-history parameters (survival, reproduction and development time) of C. carnea s.l. were analyzed. Insect pest honeydew from the olive agroecosystem and several plant species, blooming throughout the year, were found to improve C. carnea s.l. adult survival. Pollen consumption seems to be essential for reproduction. These findings are important for designing and implementing new conservation biological control approaches.

TI Entomopathogenic fungi as promising biocontrol agents for the rosaceous
   longhorn beetle, Osphranteria coerulescens
SO BIOCONTROL
AB During a survey for natural enemies of the rosaceous longhorn beetle (RLHB), Osphranteria coerulescens, two isolates of entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) were found in Razavi Khorasan province of Iran. These isolates were determined to be of the species Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae using morphological characteristics and molecular analysis. Subsequently, the mycosis process of the isolates on larvae of RLHB was documented using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In order to assess virulence of these indigenous isolates of EPF, a series of trials were conducted against RLHB larvae, pupae and adult stages. In laboratory bioassays the pest was susceptible to both EPF isolates, but the B. bassiana isolate caused significantly higher mortality than the M. anisopliae isolate in all life stages tested. In a semi-field trial EPF suspension containing 2.5 x 10(10) viable conidia per ml was sprayed directly against pest larvae beneath tree bark under two conditions: apricot branches covered with a polyvinyl cover and without cover. The B. bassiana isolate showed a higher infection rate than M. anisopliae and the cover had significant effect on larval mortality, ranging from 67 % for covered infested apricot branches to 31 % without cover in the B. bassiana treatments. Our findings revealed that polyvinyl covers were necessary to improve conidial persistence under field conditions. In a supplementary survey on the semi-mass production potential of the fungal conidia, the ability of B. bassiana and M. anisopliae to germinate was studied using three solid media. Sugar beet pulp provided the highest yield of conidia for both EPF species, and can be considered as an effective solid medium for fungal growth. These findings highlighted the potential of EPFs as biocontrol agents of O. coerulescens.

TI An advanced computational bioheat transfer model for a human body with
   an embedded systemic circulation
SO BIOMECHANICS AND MODELING IN MECHANOBIOLOGY
AB In the present work, an elaborate one-dimensional thermofluid model for a human body is presented. By contrast to the existing pure conduction-/perfusion-based models, the proposed methodology couples the arterial fluid dynamics of a human body with a multi-segmental bioheat model of surrounding solid tissues. In the present configuration, arterial flow is included through a network of elastic vessels. More than a dozen solid segments are employed to represent the heat conduction in the surrounding tissues, and each segment is constituted by a multilayered circular cylinder. Such multi-layers allow flexible delineation of the geometry and incorporation of properties of different tissue types. The coupling of solid tissue and fluid models requires subdivision of the arterial circulation into large and small arteries. The heat exchange between tissues and arterial wall occurs by convection in large vessels and by perfusion in small arteries. The core region, including the heart, provides the inlet conditions for the fluid equations. In the proposed model, shivering, sweating, and perfusion changes constitute the basis of the thermoregulatory system. The equations governing flow and heat transfer in the circulatory system are solved using a locally conservative Galerkin approach, and the heat conduction in the surrounding tissues is solved using a standard implicit backward Euler method. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed model, temperature field evolutions are monitored at different points of the arterial tree and in the surrounding tissue layers. To study the differences due to flow-induced convection effects on thermal balance, the results of the current model are compared against those of the widely used modelling methodologies. The results show that the convection significantly influences the temperature distribution of the solid tissues in the vicinity of the arteries. Thus, the inner convection has a more predominant role in the human body heat balance than previously thought. To demonstrate its capabilities, the proposed new model is used to study different scenarios, including thermoregulation inactivity and variation in surrounding atmospheric conditions.

TI Heterogeneous mechanics of the mouse pulmonary arterial network
SO BIOMECHANICS AND MODELING IN MECHANOBIOLOGY
AB Individualized modeling and simulation of blood flow mechanics find applications in both animal research and patient care. Individual animal or patient models for blood vessel mechanics are based on combining measured vascular geometry with a fluid structure model coupling formulations describing dynamics of the fluid and mechanics of the wall. For example, one-dimensional fluid flow modeling requires a constitutive law relating vessel cross-sectional deformation to pressure in the lumen. To investigate means of identifying appropriate constitutive relationships, an automated segmentation algorithm was applied to micro-computerized tomography images from a mouse lung obtained at four different static pressures to identify the static pressure-radius relationship for four generations of vessels in the pulmonary arterial network. A shape-fitting function was parameterized for each vessel in the network to characterize the nonlinear and heterogeneous nature of vessel distensibility in the pulmonary arteries. These data on morphometric and mechanical properties were used to simulate pressure and flow velocity propagation in the network using one-dimensional representations of fluid and vessel wall mechanics. Moreover, wave intensity analysis was used to study effects of wall mechanics on generation and propagation of pressure wave reflections. Simulations were conducted to investigate the role of linear versus nonlinear formulations of wall elasticity and homogeneous versus heterogeneous treatments of vessel wall properties. Accounting for heterogeneity, by parameterizing the pressure/distention equation of state individually for each vessel segment, was found to have little effect on the predicted pressure profiles and wave propagation compared to a homogeneous parameterization based on average behavior. However, substantially different results were obtained using a linear elastic thin-shell model than were obtained using a nonlinear model that has a more physiologically realistic pressure versus radius relationship.

TI Adaptive outflow boundary conditions improve post-operative predictions
   after repair of peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis
SO BIOMECHANICS AND MODELING IN MECHANOBIOLOGY
AB Peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis (PPS) is a congenital abnormality resulting in pulmonary blood flow disparity and right ventricular hypertension. Despite recent advance in catheter-based interventions, surgical reconstruction is still preferred to treat complex PPS. However optimal surgical strategies remain unclear. It would be of great benefit to be able to predict post-operative hemodynamics to assist with surgical planning toward optimizing outcomes. While image-based computational fluid dynamics has been used in cardiovascular surgical planning, most studies have focused on the impact of local geometric changes on hemodynamic performance. Previous experimental studies suggest morphological changes in the pulmonary arteries not only alter local hemodynamics but also lead to distal pulmonary adaptation. In this proof of concept study, a constant shear stress hypothesis and structured pulmonary trees are used to derive adaptive outflow boundary conditions for post-operative simulations. Patient-specific simulations showed the adaptive outflow boundary conditions by the constant shear stress model to provide better predictions of pulmonary flow distribution than the conventional strategy of maintaining outflow boundary conditions. On average, the relative difference, when compared to the gold standard clinical test, in blood flow distribution to the right lung is reduced from 20 to 4 %. This suggests adaptive outflow boundary conditions should be incorporated into post-operative modeling in patients with complex PPS.

SO BIOTECHNOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGICAL EQUIPMENT
AB Economically important representatives of the Artemisia genus have wide application in pharmaceutics, landscape architecture and agriculture. The aim of this study was to phylogenetically analyse the 18S-26S rDNA, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) nucleotide sequences of 19 Artemisia samples collected from Ordu Province of Turkey. Analyses were conducted using neighbour-joining (NJ), maximum-parsimony (MP) and maximum-likelihood (ML) algorithms. Our analysis revealed two unique haplotypes within our samples, including a rare one (Haplotype-I, represented by a single sample) and a common one (Haplotype-II, represented by 18 samples). In all trees, both of our haplotypes appeared in the same lineage with Artemisia sylvatica, Artemisia argyi and Artemisia verlotiorum. Although rDNA-ITS is known to be a variative marker, oddly it was highly conserved in Artemisia, which is why we used this marker to determine the phylogenetic affiliation of the analysed plants.

TI Use of ISSR markers to assess the genetic diversity in wild medicinal
   Ziziphus spina-christi (L.) Willd. collected from different regions of

SO BIOTECHNOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGICAL EQUIPMENT
AB Ziziphus spina-christi (sidr) is a shrub, sometimes a tree, native to a vast area of Africa stretching from Mauritania to West Africa. In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, it is an exotic medicinal plant for many diseases. The aim of this study was to assess the genetic diversity within and among 34 accessions of Z. spina-christi collected from different regions of Saudi Arabia. The amplification of genomic DNA with 11 inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) primers yielded 105 scorable loci, of which 93.4% were found to be polymorphic. The observed number of alleles (na), effective number of alleles (ne), Nei's gene diversity (h) and genetic diversity estimated by Shannon's information index (I) were 1.93, 1.44, 0.26 and 0.41, respectively. The total genetic diversity, H-t (0.266 +/- 0.0289) was close to the average intrapopulation genetic diversity, H-s (0.2199 +/- 0.0216). A high level of gene flow (N-m = 2.37) between populations, reflecting high genetic differentiation (G(st) = 0.1739). The analysis of molecular variance showed that the maximum value of genetic variation was found within populations (90%), whereas a low value of genetic variance was observed among populations. The analysis using the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic averages clustered the population from Farasan Island as an out-group due to its geographical origin. The obtained results demonstrate that the ISSR markers may be used for evaluation of the genetic diversity due to their efficiency in revealing polymorphism even in closely related germplasm and may help in Ziziphus genome analysis.

   carpinifolia Scop.) populations in Turkey
SO BIOTECHNOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGICAL EQUIPMENT
AB Genetic diversity is a crucial component for plant survivability and fitness in terms of adaptation, genetic stability and variability. In this study, a total of 160 genotypes were investigated using 12 random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) primers to understand the genetic structure and diversity of nine naturally distributed Ostrya carpinifolia populations in Turkey. Twelve RAPD primers yielded 111 clearly identifiable DNA bands, of which 71 bands were found to be polymorphic (64%). Observed number of alleles (Na), effective number of alleles (Ne) and Nei's gene diversity (h) were found as 2, 1.53 and 0.32, respectively. Total genetic variation (H-T), within-population genetic variation (H-S) and Nei's genetic differentiation coefficient (G(ST)) were found as 0.32, 0.09 and 0.70, respectively. Genetic diversity analysis (AMOVA) revealed highly significant (P < 0.001) genetic variations among and within populations. 69.94% of total variation was observed among populations while 26.69% was within populations. Gene flow value was calculated as 0.21 (Nm < 0.5), which could homogenize the genetic structure of a population. Two geographically isolated populations demonstrated high gene diversity and polymorphic loci ratio, indicating a relationship between geographic distribution of populations and eco-geographic factors. The findings of this study will pave the way for understanding the genetic diversity between inter- and intra-populations of O. carpinifolia species, as well as they would provide valuable information for management, conservation and utilization of in situ and ex situ Ostrya germplasms.

TI The effect of the East Atlantic pattern on the precipitation delta
   O-18-NAO relationship in Europe
SO CLIMATE DYNAMICS
AB The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is known to influence precipitation delta O-18 (delta O-18(p)) through its control on air temperature and on the trajectory of the westerly winds that carry moisture onto Europe during boreal winters. Hence, paleoclimate studies seeking to reconstruct the NAO can exploit the delta O-18 signal that is commonly preserved in natural archives such as stalagmites, ice cores, tree rings and lake sediments. However, such reconstructions should consider the uncertainties that arise from non-stationarities in the delta O-18(p)-NAO relationship. Here, new insights into the causes of these temporal non-stationarities are presented for the European region using both observations (GNIP database) and the output of an isotope-enabled general circulation model (ECHAM5-wiso). The results show that, although the East Atlantic (EA) pattern is generally uncorrelated to delta O-18(p) during the instrumental period, its polarity affects the delta O-18(p)-NAO relationship. Non-stationarities in this relationship result from spatial shifts of the delta O-18(p)-NAO correlated areas as a consequence of different NAO/EA combinations. These shifts are consistent with those reported previously for NAO-winter climate variables and the resulting non-stationarities mean that delta O-18-based NAO reconstructions could be compromised if the balance of positive and negative NAO/EA states differs substantially in a calibration period compared with the period of interest in the past. The same approach has been followed to assess the relationships between delta O-18(p) and both winter total precipitation and winter mean surface air temperature, with similar results. Crucially, this study also identifies regions within Europe where temporal changes in the NAO, air temperature and precipitation can be more robustly reconstructed using delta O-18 time series from natural archives, irrespective of concomitant changes in the EA.

TI Metabolic Tumor Volume and Total Lesion Glycolysis in PET/CT Correlate
   With the Pathological Findings of Colorectal Cancer and Allow Its
   Accurate Staging
SO CLINICAL NUCLEAR MEDICINE
AB Introduction PET/CT plays an important role in cancer diagnosis. Recently, novel metabolic parameters in PET/CT such as metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) have been reported to be diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of various cancers. We evaluated the diagnostic value of these metabolic parameters in colorectal cancer (CRC).
   Methods The study included 138 patients who underwent surgical resection of CRCs between August 2012 and March 2014. The MTVs and TLGs of tumors were measured using various SUV thresholds. The diagnostic abilities of the metabolic parameters were analyzed using ROC curves and classification and regression trees.
   Results The AUCs of the MTVs and TLGs for predicting T stage (0.881-0.892) were significantly higher than the AUC of the SUVmax (0.824). In the M stage, the AUCs of MTVs and TLGs (0.688-0.723) were significantly higher than that of the SUVmax (0.606). Recursive partitioning applying classification and regression trees demonstrated that the optimal cutoff values of the most important variables for discriminating T, N, and M stages are MTV2.5 = 9.35 and 63.33 mL, TLG50% = 328.1, and TLG50% = 94.81, respectively.
   Conclusion Metabolic tumor volumes and TLGs in PET/CT are reliable diagnostic biomarkers. Using these parameters, more accurate preoperative diagnoses for CRC can be made.

TI Multivariate topology simplification
SO COMPUTATIONAL GEOMETRY-THEORY AND APPLICATIONS
AB Topological simplification of scalar and vector fields is well-established as an effective method for analysing and visualising complex data sets. For multivariate (alternatively, multi-field) data, topological analysis requires simultaneous advances both mathematically and computationally. We propose a robust multivariate topology simplification method based on "lip"-pruning from the Reeb space. Mathematically, we show that the projection of the Jacobi set of multivariate data into the Reeb space produces a Jacobi structure that separates the Reeb space into simple components. We also show that the dual graph of these components gives rise to a Reeb skeleton that has properties similar to the scalar contour tree and Reeb graph, for topologically simple domains. We then introduce a range measure to give a scaling-invariant total ordering of the components or features that can be used for simplification. Computationally, we show how to compute Jacobi structure, Reeb skeleton, range and geometric measures in the Joint Contour Net (an approximation of the Reeb space) and that these can be used for visualisation similar to the contour tree or Reeb graph.

TI Optimal randomized incremental construction for guaranteed logarithmic
   planar point location
SO COMPUTATIONAL GEOMETRY-THEORY AND APPLICATIONS
AB Given a planar map of n segments in which we wish to efficiently locate points, we present the first randomized incremental construction of the well-known trapezoidal-map search-structure that only requires expected O (nlogn) preprocessing time while deterministically guaranteeing worst-case linear storage space and worst-case logarithmic query time. The best previously known randomized construction time of the search structure, which is based on a directed acyclic graph, so-called the history DAG, and with the above worst case space and query-time guarantees, was expected O (n log(2) n). The result is based on a deeper understanding of the structure of the history DAG, its depth in relation to the length of its longest search path, as well as its correspondence to the trapezoidal search tree. Our results immediately extend to planar maps induced by finite collections of pairwise interior disjoint well-behaved curves. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Alternating paths and cycles of minimum length
SO COMPUTATIONAL GEOMETRY-THEORY AND APPLICATIONS
AB Let R be a set of n red points and B be a set of n blue points in the Euclidean plane. We study the problem of computing a planar drawing of a cycle of minimum length that contains vertices at points R boolean OR B and alternates colors. When these points are collinear, we describe a Theta(n log n)-time algorithm to find such a shortest alternating cycle where every edge has at most two bends. We extend our approach to compute shortest alternating paths in O (n(2)) time with two bends per edge and to compute shortest alternating cycles on 3-colored point sets in O (n(2)) time with O (n) bends per edge. We also prove that for arbitrary k-colored point sets, the problem of computing an alternating shortest cycle is NP-hard, where k is any positive integer constant. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI Modified Camelorum tree particles as a new adsorbent for adsorption of
   Hg(II) from aqueous solutions: kinetics, thermodynamics and non-linear
   isotherms
SO DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT
AB Camelorum tree (CT), a desert plant, has been utilized as an adsorbent material for the removal of Hg(II) ions from aqueous solution after treatment with malic acid at elevated temperature. Treated Camelorum tree (TCT) were found to exhibit excellent adsorption capacity over a wide range of Hg(II) concentration. Native CT and TCT were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy to support the adsorption of Hg(II) ions. Effect of various parameters such as pH, adsorbent concentration, contact time, initial concentration, and temperature was investigated using batch process to optimize conditions for maximum adsorption. The adsorption data were analyzed using two, three, four, and five parameter models at 30 degrees C using nonlinear regression analysis. The maximum adsorption capacity (q(max)) of Hg(II) onto TCT was 357.14mg/g at an initial pH of 5 and a temperature of 30 degrees C. Thermodynamic parameters such as standard enthalpy change (H degrees), free energy change (G degrees), and entropy change (S degrees) were also evaluated and the results indicated that adsorption of Hg(II) is spontaneous and exothermic. Various kinetics models including the pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, intraparticle diffusion, Bangham, and Elovich models have been applied to the experimental data to predict the adsorption kinetics. Kinetic study was carried out by varying initial concentration of Hg(II) at constant temperature and it was found that pseudo-second-order rate equation was better obeyed than pseudo-first-order equation supporting that chemisorption process was involved. The examination of R-2 values and error analysis methods showed that the Langmuir-Freundlich, Dubinin-Radushkevich, Fritz-Schlunder (IV), and Fritz-Schlunder (V) models provide the best fit to experimental data than other isotherms and follow the following order: Langmuir-Freundlich (three parameter isotherm) > Dubinin-Radushkevich (two parameter isotherm) > Fritz-Schlunder (four parameter isotherm) > Fritz-Schlunder (five parameter isotherm). The obtained results show that TCT can be used as an effective and a low-cost adsorbent for the removal of Hg(II) from aqueous solutions.

TI Removal of Cr(VI) from aqueous solution using Strychnos nux-vomica shell
   as an adsorbent
SO DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT
AB In the present study, the removal of Cr(VI) from aqueous solution by a Strychnos nux-vomica shell was examined in a batch study. The main process parameters such as adsorbent dose, pH, initial concentration, temperature, agitation speed and contact time were studied. The result shows that the maximum removal of Cr(VI) was observed at pH 2. The progressive changes on surface texture and the confirmation of chromium binding on adsorbent surface at different stages were obtained by the scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectrometer analysis. The equilibrium data from the biosorption study was evaluated by the use of two parameter isotherm models. Langmuir isotherm model seems to fit better with the equilibrium data. Kinetic studies were performed using pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order and intraparticle diffusion models. The biosorption data were found to best fitted for pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The calculated thermodynamic parameters such as G degrees, H degrees and S degrees showed that the adsorption of Cr(VI) ions onto adsorbents was spontaneous, endothermic and increased randomness in nature. The results indicate that STFS can be an effective adsorbent for the removal of Cr(VI) from aqueous solutions.

TI Characterizing the Status (Disturbed, Hybrid or Novel) of Swamp Forest
   Fragments in a Caribbean Ramsar Wetland: The Impact of Anthropogenic
   Degradation and Invasive Plant Species
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB The last remaining Amazonian-type swamp forest fragments in Black River Lower Morass, Jamaica, have been subjected to a myriad of anthropogenic disturbances, compounded by the establishment and spread of several invasive plant species. We established 44 permanent sample plots (covering 3.92 ha) across 10 of these swamp forest fragments and sampled all non-woody plants and all trees aeyen2 cm DBH found in the plots. These data were used to (1) identify thresholds of hybridity and novelty, (2) derive several diversity and structural descriptors used to characterize the swamp forest fragments and (3) identify possible indicators of anthropogenic degradation. These were incorporated into a framework and used to determine the status of the swamp forest fragments so that appropriate management and conservation measures can be implemented. We recorded 43 woody plant species (9 endemic, 28 native and 4 non-native) and 21 non-tree species. The composition and structure of all the patches differed significantly due to the impact of the herbaceous invasive plant Alpinia allughas, the presence and diversity of other non-native plants, and differing intensities of anthropogenic disturbance (e.g., burning, cutting and harvesting of non-timber forest products). We ranked forest patches along a continuum representing deviations from a historical proxy (least disturbed) swamp forest to those with dramatically altered structural and floristic attributes (=novel swamp forests). Only one fragment overrun with A. allughas was classified as novel. If effective conservation and management does not come to the BRLM, the remaining swamp forest fragments appear doomed to further degradation and will soon disappear altogether.

TI Planning for restorative forests: describing stress-reducing qualities
   of forest stands using available forest stand data
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
AB Research suggests that certain forest environments can contribute to lower stress levels in humans. This might be increasingly important to consider given the rising prevalence of stress-related diseases and illness absence. To make it feasible to plan for forest management strategies that take such restorative effects into account, it would seem to be important to identify the precise physical properties that contribute to the restorative qualities of forest stands. It would also be useful if forest stand data typically already collected by forest owners could be used for this purpose. In the present study, forest stands in northern, central, and southern Sweden were visited and assessed regarding their restorative potential. These assessments were analysed together with available forest stand data for each region using statistical models. Our results indicate that of the available forest stand data parameters, the most important individual indicators of forest stands' restorative qualities were tree age, tree sparsity, and tree height. Models based on these parameters explained 30-40 % of the variation in restorative qualities among the evaluated stands, indicating that they can be useful in planning and modelling scenarios where restorative properties of forest stands are considered.

TI Genetic parameters for wood quality traits and resistance to the
   pathogens Heterobasidion parviporum and Endoconidiophora polonica in a
   Norway spruce breeding population
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
AB The root rot pathogens in Norway spruce (Picea abies) Heterobasidion ssp. cause substantial loss in carbon sequestered in forest and economic revenue for forest owners. To facilitate strategic breeding planning for increased resistance against this pathogen in particular, the blue stain fungus Endoconidiophora polonica, growth and wood quality traits (wood density and spiral grain), we estimated additive genetic parameters, correlations and the potential response from selection. Parameters were estimated from a progeny trial series established at two sites (25 years from planting) and their parents in a seed orchard (43 years from grafting). A standard half-sib analysis based on progenies and a parent-offspring regression was used for estimation of heritabilities. Resistance against the pathogens was measured as lesion length under bark after inoculations in phloem. Heritability values varied with site and estimation procedure from 0.06 to 0.33, whereas the phenotypic variance (as CV (P) ) is high and fairly stable around 40-50 %. Heritability values for wood density and spiral grain in the same material varied from 0.32 to 0.63. The highest heritability values were generally obtained from parent-offspring regression. There is no evidence of resistance traits being genetically correlated with growth or wood quality traits. Wood density is negatively correlated with stem diameter. Implications for breeding are discussed.

TI Nestling food of three hole-nesting passerine species and experimental
   increase in their densities in Mediterranean oak woodlands
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
AB We studied nestling food of three species breeding in Mediterranean oak woodlands that collect food in different niches of trees: blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus; foliage-gleaner), great tit (Parus major; bark-foliage-gleaner) and nuthatch (Sitta europaea; bark-gleaner) in 2013-2014. Species-specific functions were compared using size and composition of preyed caterpillars, and nest-boxes were used in a before-after control-impact (BACI) design to test increase in breeding densities by providing nest-boxes. Our results demonstrate a high importance of caterpillars in the nestling diet of the three passerine species and suggest their complementary predation on early and late instars of the same Lepidoptera species. According to results of our BACI experiment, species' breeding density increased by providing nest-boxes, with blue tit showing the highest difference in percentage change between manipulated and control plots (38.2, 26.8 and 14.3 % for blue tit, great tit and nuthatch, respectively). Overall, we highlight the combined functions of different tree-foraging guilds in caterpillar predation and propose nest-box provision as a management method to prevent defoliator outbreaks in Mediterranean oak woodlands.

TI Ungulates decelerate litter decomposition by altering litter quality
   above and below ground
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
AB Ungulates can greatly affect forest ecosystems' functional characteristics. However, limited information is available about their influence on litter decomposition, a major ecosystem process, despite disturbance of ungulates on vegetation through selective browsing and trampling. This study focused on effects of the presence/absence of deer herbivory on decomposition of leaves and roots of three major tree species in a Hokkaido, Japan forest. Our litterbag experiment showed that litter decomposition was significantly faster for both leaves and roots in a deer exclosure than in a control site with deer herbivory. Possible factors for this slowed decomposition because of deer presence include their physical disturbance on soil through trampling. In both sites, the remaining mass of litter was positively correlated with the C:N ratio and lignin content. When analyzed for leaf litter, species with lower C:N ratio and lignin content showed lower litter mass remaining in both sites. Deer generally prefer species with a low leaf C:N ratio and lignin content; the results suggest that leaves of palatable species were less resistant to decomposition. A similar interspecific difference in decomposition was not observed for roots, most likely resulting from the small difference in root litter quality among species. In this forest, tree species with unpalatable leaves, which are becoming predominant, likely decreases leaf litter decomposition, as leaves of palatable plants decompose more rapidly. Roots, however, are not exposed to browsing, regardless of aboveground palatability, and remain within soil as a recalcitrant slowly decomposing litter substrate. These synergetic influences could allow deer herbivory to reduce overall plant decomposition rates aboveground and belowground via changes in plant species composition.

TI Responses of photosynthetic parameters to differences in winter
   temperatures throughout a temperature gradient in two evergreen tree
   species
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
AB The temperature dependence of photosynthetic parameters has been a focus of interest during recent years owing to its profound implications in the new climate scenario. Many studies have addressed the short-term responses of photosynthetic parameters to temperature change. Less attention has been given to the intraspecific variability in the biochemical parameters of photosynthesis in response to differences in growth temperature. This study explores the effects of winter harshness on the leaf traits of two evergreen tree species (Quercus ilex and Q. suber). Leaf mass per unit area (LMA) and the concentrations of fiber, nitrogen (N), soluble protein, chlorophyll and ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) were determined in both species throughout a temperature gradient. Several photosynthetic parameters [maximum carboxylation rate (V (cmax)), maximum light-driven electron flux (J (max)), day respiration rate (R (d)) and relative stomatal limitation to photosynthesis] were assessed by measuring leaf response curves of net CO2 assimilation versus intercellular CO2 partial pressure. LMA and structural carbohydrate concentrations increased with the decrease in winter temperatures, whereas N concentrations did not show definite patterns. Chlorophyll, soluble proteins, Rubisco, V (cmax) and J (max) declined with the decrease in winter temperatures, whereas R (d) at a set common temperature (25 A degrees C) was higher at colder sites. Our results suggest that an increase in LMA and in the concentration of structural carbohydrates in cold environments is associated with a reduced N allocation to the photosynthetic machinery, which leads to reduced photosynthetic capacity.

TI Scenario analysis of planting density and pre-commercial thinning: will
   the mixed forest have a chance?
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
AB In the establishment phase, several management alternatives could be applied that affect the species composition of the future stand. In this study, tree seedling data from experiments with planted Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst) and naturally regenerated species, mainly Silver birch (Betula pendula Roth), were used for six simulated pre-commercial thinning (PCT) scenarios. The scenarios included both monocultures and mixed stand alternatives with various initial spacing of the planted Norway spruce (0, 1600 or 2800 seedlings) and selection of main stems based on relative heights. Further stand development and individual tree growth were simulated until final harvest. Potentially, based on findings of the seedling measurements, the stands could be mixed with five to six species, but the browsing pressure from ungulates reduced this possibility since the height growth for all species except Norway spruce was highly affected by browsing. The simulated mixtures had a small variation between the PCT scenarios for the maximum mean annual increment (about 10 %). Although the growth was similar for Norway spruce, the proportion of birch in the final stands differed from 3 to 21 % between treatments and none of the high-density planting treatments generated a mixed Norway spruce-birch forest at the time of final felling.

TI Consistent limitation of growth by high temperature and low
   precipitation from range core to southern edge of European beech
   indicates widespread vulnerability to changing climate
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
AB The aim of our study was to determine variation in the response of radial growth in Fagus sylvatica L (European Beech) to climate across the species full geographical distribution and climatic tolerance. We combined new and existing data to build a database of 140 tree-ring chronologies to investigate patterns in growth-climate relationships. Our novel meta-analysis approach has allowed the first investigation of the effect of climate on tree growth across the entire geographical distribution of the species. We identified key climate signals in tree-ring chronologies and then investigated how these varied geographically and according to mean local climate, and by tree age and size. We found that the most important climate variables significantly correlated with growth did not show strong geographical patterns. Growth of trees in the core and at the southern edge of the distribution was reduced by high temperature and low precipitation during the growing season, and by high temperatures in the previous summer. However, growth of trees growing in warmer and drier locations was more frequently significantly correlated with summer precipitation than other populations. Additionally, the growth of older and larger trees was more frequently significantly correlated with previous summer temperature than younger and smaller trees. Trees growing at the south of the species geographical distributions are often considered most at risk from climate change, but our results indicate that radial growth of populations in other areas of the distribution is equally likely to be significantly correlated with summer climate and may also be vulnerable. Additionally, tree-rings from older trees contain particular growth-climate relationships that are rarely found in younger trees. These results have important implications for predicting forest carbon balance, resource use and likely future changes to forest composition across the continent.

TI Nutritional and defensive properties of Fagaceae nuts dispersed by
   animals: a multiple species study
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
AB Seeds usually exhibit physical and chemical defensive properties; however, it is still debated whether there is trade-off between the two defensive traits. Moreover, the relationship between nutritional and defensive properties of seeds is rarely investigated. In this study, we measured chemical compositions and physical properties of 29 species/varieties in Fagaceae with different seed traits, to investigate variations in nutritional and defensive properties at interspecific level. Our study provided evident nutritional trade-off in Fagaceae nuts, i.e., the concentration of protein and fat was negatively correlated with that of starch. However, no clear trade-off between physical and chemical defensive traits was found, indicating coordinated defense syndromes in these Fagaceae species. Chemical defense in Fagaceae nuts was positively associated with fat and protein but negatively with the content of starch. The congruence between phylogenetic tree and seed trait cladogram indicated conservative evolution of seed traits. In addition, large nuts had high concentration of protein and fat, resulting in a positive relationship between seed coat thickness and caloric values. Fagaceae nuts with high nutrition tended to invest more energy into physical defenses, indicating that the trade-off between chemical and physical defenses might be seed size dependent across plant species.

TI Effects of uncertainty in upper-stem diameter information on tree volume
   estimates
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
AB Almost all relevant data in forestry databases arise from either field measurement or model prediction. In either case, these values have some amount of uncertainty that is often overlooked when doing analyses. In this study, the uncertainty associated with both measured and predicted data was quantified for upper-stem diameter at 5.27 m. This uncertainty was propagated through a tree taper model into predictions of individual-tree volume. The effects of uncertainty on individual-tree volume predictions and population estimates of total volume were assessed. Generally, when little or no systematic measurement deviation was present, less uncertainty was associated with field-measured diameters compared to model predictions. However, diameters predicted from a model were preferred when systematic deviations in field measurement exceeded approximately 0.2 cm. Comparisons of results obtained from an alternative taper model showed that more precise estimates of population totals might be obtained without upper-stem diameter information. Upper-stem diameter information increases the prediction accuracy of individual-tree volume, and thus, models using this information may be preferable in applications such as timber sales containing high-value trees. Due to the various factors that influence measurement and modeling uncertainty, foresters are encouraged to make similar evaluations in the context of their specific activities.

TI Species-specific and general allometric equations for estimating tree
   biomass components of subtropical forests in southern China
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
AB Chinese subtropical forests contain a diversity of tree species and exhibit a high carbon (C) sequestration capacity, but biomass and C stock assessments in subtropical secondary forests remain uncertain because of a limited availability of allometric equations and an uncertain applicability of existing allometric equations that have not been tested for these forests. We developed allometric equations for important coniferous (Pinus massoniana), deciduous broadleaved (Alniphyllum fortunei, Choerospondias axillaris, Liquidambar formosana) and evergreen broadleaved (Cyclobalanopsis glauca, Litsea rotundifolia, Schima superba) species. A total of 70 trees (10 trees for each species) with diameters at breast height (D) ranging from 2.6 to 50.9 cm were destructively harvested and dissected into tree components (stem, branch, leaf and coarse root). Species-specific equations using D alone as the predictor variable fitted the data well (p < 0.0053 and R (2) > 0.72) for each tree component. Including height (H) in the form of D (2) H only improved the regression fit for A. fortunei and L. rotundifolia. The relationships of branch, leaf and root biomass against D varied among tree species. General equations for functional groups and all species combined showed comparable bias for stem, aboveground and total tree biomass to species-specific equations. We recommend the general equations of multiple species to estimate forest biomass at regional scales and also to estimate stem, aboveground and total tree biomass for each species when species-specific allometric equations are not available at a given site. For branch, leaf and root biomass, species-specific equations are preferred, even though this requires biomass data for additional tree species.

AB Conceptual models that describe temperate forest dynamics differ substantially between Europe and America. In Europe, the concept of the forest cycle describes a sequentially shifting fine-scale mosaic of patches in different phases of forest development. In North America, the descriptive concept is largely based on severe coarse-scale disturbances that repeat in a cyclic fashion and restart the succession of the whole forest stand from initiation through to 'old-growth,' neglecting the within-stand dynamics on the patch level. Here, we investigate fine-scale stand structures across European and North American forests by applying the European concept of forest developmental phases to all stands. The patches of four major forest developmental stages were recognized and delineated by the spatially explicit rule-based classification system implemented in GIS, which employs stem position maps of live and dead trees for analysis. The basic quantitative characteristics of identified patch structures in the N. American stands, as the Mean Patch Size of the mosaic (between 760 and 890 m(2)), were comparable with European old-growth stands, although mosaic complexity was higher in the latter. We demonstrated that in addition to the large-scale forest cycle assumed by N. American conceptual models there simultaneously exist finer-scale patch dynamics described by the European conceptual model. We also demonstrated that the occurrence of the Steady State stage was promoted by higher local tree species richness, which may explain the abundant occurrence of this stage in N. American secondary stands. The Steady State stage of the European model might represent an important commonality across both paradigms.

TI High-throughput sequencing reveals diverse oomycete communities in
   oligotrophic peat bog micro-habitat
SO FUNGAL ECOLOGY
AB Oomycete diversity has been generally underestimated, despite their ecological and economic importance. Surveying unexplored natural ecosystems with up-to-date molecular diversity tools can reveal the existence of unsuspected organisms. Here, we have explored the molecular diversity of five microhabitats located in five different oligotrophic peat bogs in the Jura Mountains using a high throughput sequencing approach (Illumina HiSeq 2500). We found a total of 34 different phylotypes distributed in all major oomycete clades, and comprising sequences affiliated to both well-known phylotypes and members of undescribed, basal clades. Parasitic species, including obligate forms were well -represented, and phylotypes related to highly damaging invasive pathogens (Aphanomyces astaci: X1100 and Saprolegnia parasitica: X1602) were retrieved. Microhabitats differed significantly in their community composition, and many phylotypes were strongly affiliated to free water habitats (pools). Our approach proved effective in screening oomycete diversity in the studied habitat, and could be applied systematically to other environments and other fungal and fungal-like groups.

TI Do foliar fungal communities of Norway spruce shift along a tree species
   diversity gradient in mature European forests?
SO FUNGAL ECOLOGY
AB Foliar fungal species are diverse and colonize all plants, though whether forest tree species composition influences the distribution of these fungal communities remains unclear. Fungal communities include quiescent taxa and the functionally important and metabolically active taxa that respond to changes in the environment. To determine fungal community shifts along a tree species diversity gradient, needles of Norway spruce were sampled from trees from four mature European forests. We hypothesized that the fungal communities and specific fungal taxa would correlate with tree species diversity. Furthermore, the active fungal community, and not the total community, would shift along the tree diversity gradient. High-throughput sequencing showed significant differences in the fungal communities in the different forests, and in one forest, tree diversity effects were observed, though this was not a general phenomenon. Our study also suggests that studying the metabolically active community may not provide additional information about community composition or diversity. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

TI Fungi associated with decomposing deadwood in a natural beech-dominated
   forest
SO FUNGAL ECOLOGY
AB Deadwood represents a specific habitat of particular importance in natural, unmanaged forests where wood is not harvested. Here, we characterized the basic wood chemistry, enzyme activity, fungal biomass content and community composition of Fagus sylvatica, Abies alba and Picea abies coarse woody debris decomposing for <5, 5-15, 16-38 and >38 years in a natural temperate forest. The results indicate that coarse deadwood represents a highly diverse substratum in terms of the quality, fungal biomass content and, in particular, the composition of fungal communities whose properties change with time. Because sequences recovered from individual logs were typically dominated by one or few fungal species, which were rarely tree species-specific, the community assembly appeared to show a high level of stochasticity. Among the estimated variables, nitrogen content that increased with decay length was the most important candidate driver of fungal biomass content, community composition and enzyme activity.

TI Ant-cultivated Chaetothyriales in hollow stems of myrmecophytic Cecropia
   sp trees - diversity and patterns
SO FUNGAL ECOLOGY
AB Five Cecropia tree species occupied by four Azteca ant species from Costa Rica and French Guiana were investigated to assess the diversity and host specificity of chaetothyrialean fungal symbionts. The ITS rDNA region of the symbiotic fungi was sequenced either from pure culture isolation, or from environmental samples obtained from ant colonies nesting in hollow stems of the Cecropia host plants. The investigation revealed six closely related OTUs of Chattothyriales. Neither the four Azteca species nor the six fungal OTUs were associated with specific Cecropia species. In contrast, ants and fungi showed an association. Azteca alfari was associated with a particular OTU, and often contained only one. Azteca coeruleipennis, Azteca constructor and Azteca xanthochroa were associated with a different set of OTUs and often had multiple OTUs within colonies. Possible reasons for these differences and the role of the fungi for the Azteca-Cecropia symbiosis are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society. All rights reserved.

TI The geographic distribution and complex evolutionary history of the NX-2
   trichothecene chemotype from Fusarium graminearum
SO FUNGAL GENETICS AND BIOLOGY
AB Fusarium graminearum and 21 related species comprising the F. sambucinum species complex lineage 1 (FSAMSC-1) are the most important Fusarium Head Blight pathogens of cereal crops world-wide. FSAMSC-1 species typically produce type B trichothecenes. However, some F. graminearum strains were recently found to produce a novel type A trichothecene (NX-2) resulting from functional variation in the trichothecene biosynthetic enzyme Tril. We used a PCR-RFLP assay targeting the TRI1 gene to identify the NX-2 allele among a global collection of 2515 F. graminearum. NX-2 isolates were only found in southern Canada and the northern U.S., where they were observed at low frequency (1.8%), but over a broader geographic range and set of cereal hosts than previously recognized. Phylogenetic analyses of TRI1 and adjacent genes produced gene trees that were incongruent with the history of species divergence within FSAMSC-1, indicating trans-species evolution of ancestral polymorphism. In addition, placement of NX-2 strains in the TRI1 gene tree was influenced by the accumulation of nonsynonymous substitutions associated with the evolution of the NX-2 chemotype, and a significant (A < 0.001) change in selection pressure was observed along the NX-2 branch (co = 1.16) in comparison to other branches (omega = 0.17) in the TRI1 phylogeny. Parameter estimates were consistent with positive selection for specific amino acid changes during the evolution of NX-2, but direct tests of positive selection were not significant. Phylogenetic analyses of fourfold degenerate sites and intron sequences in TRI1 indicated the NX-2 chemotype had a single evolutionary origin and evolved recently from a type B ancestor. Our results indicate the NX-2 chemotype may be indigenous, and possibly endemic, to southern Canada and the northern U.S. In addition, we demonstrate that the evolution of TRH within FSAMSC-1 has been complex, with evidence of trans-species evolution and chemotype-specific shifts in selective constraint.

TI Methods for delimiting species via population genetics and phylogenetics
   using genotype data
SO GENES & GENOMICS
AB In species delimitation, a formidable goal in the discipline of systematic biology, we identify and describe species morphologically and ecologically based on phenotypic data. Efficient genotyping technologies produce genetic and genomic data with relative ease, which promotes species discovery and validation using genotype data. For the last two decades, we have seen the development of species delimitation methods based on genetic distances and phylogenetic trees using genotype data. However, speciation processes via evolutionary relationship among species were mostly divorced from species delimitation. Recent approaches to drawing species boundaries use multi-locus sequence data to account for evolutionary processes including speciation and gene flow. They allow us to learn of jointly speciation and species delimitation, leveraging computational and statistical techniques developed in population genetics and phylogenetics. Here, we review the recent progress in the development of species delimitation using genotype data and discuss the future outlook for the research of developing species delimitation methods.

TI Parasitic angiosperms as cultivated plants?
SO GENETIC RESOURCES AND CROP EVOLUTION
AB The knowledge about parasitic plants has increased in the latest years. Their importance as economic plants is generally considered low. Some of the species came into cultivation mainly as medicinal plants, fruit trees and some as vegetables. Only Olacaceae (1), Opiliaceae (1), Santalaceae (6), Viscaceae (1), Ximeniaceae (1) and Orobanchaceae (3) contain some cultivated species (number in brackets). Santalum spp. (root parasites) and Viscum album (stem parasite) are of greater importance for the production of sandalwood oil and an anti-cancer medicine, respectively. Their parasitic nature is well known to the growers. In other cases, the parasitic nature is not noted, especially in semiparasitic root species (Arjona, Anacolosa). New results are to be expected with holoparasitic root parasites (Cistanche, Orobanche).

TI Classification-Based Record Linkage With Pseudonymized Data for
   Epidemiological Cancer Registries
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA
AB Cancer is one of the widest spread diseases in human society. Therefore, the need has grown to monitor, evaluate, and predict its development. Cancer registries address this problem by collecting data on cancer cases, striving for high quality, accuracy, and completeness. One of the basic challenges in this context is the linkage of data from multiple sources. In order to link new cancer records with existing ones, the cancer registries typically use an algorithm referred to as record linkage. Although the algorithm has automated a significant amount of the linking process, there still is a certain percentage of records that cannot be linked automatically. This study addresses the problem of reducing the need of manually matching records with machine learning methods. The particular challenge is caused by pseudonymization of the data. The main contribution is thus finding ways to encode the-pseudonymized-data, i.e., feature extraction so that it can be interpreted by a classifier. Three classifiers (neural network, support vector machines, decision tree) manage to achieve at least 93% classification rate on a dataset of 73 000 cancer records extracted from the inventory of a cancer registry. In addition, ensemble techniques boost the performance further to over 95%. We present an in-depth discussion of the experimental results from a perspective of applying the classification-based record linkage in real practice. Two scenarios of translating to practice will be outlined with a potential of reducing the human workload by an order of magnitude of hundreds of hours.

TI Background Subtraction Using Background Sets With Image- and Color-Space
   Reduction
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA
AB Background subtraction is a basic step for a variety of multimedia applications such as live video, traffic monitoring, communication system, interactive learning space, etc. Many approaches have been proposed for this problem, but the need for lower cost approaches still exists. In this paper, a relatively low-cost background-subtraction method is proposed, using background sets with image- and color-space reduction. The background sets are used to detect objects from dynamic backgrounds, which contain waves, trees, and fountains. The image space is reduced to deal with jittered and unsteady frames, e.g., the input from handheld mobile devices. The color space is reduced to compensate for color noise, e.g., the scattered RGB values of a digital camera. To reduce the cost, a combination of color-space reduction and hash-table look-up operations are used. The results compared with other methods show the feasibility of our method; moreover, it can be useful in mobile or embedded environments.

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SUSTAINABLE ENERGY
AB In this paper, a new investigation on islanding detection method is presented for PV-based VSC system. The proposed PV-VSC is represented as one of the distributed energy resource (DER) for a microgrid environment. A new multivariable dynamic model is presented in terms of two stage conversion with a dc-dc converter for the proposed PV-VSC system. The proposed VSC system is controlled primarily by a positive sequence P-Q loop, at the PCC. A new backstepping fast sliding mode control (BFSMC) is proposed for primary PWM control of VSC system. During sudden grid disconnection an islanding protection loop based on rate of change in voltage harmonic profile injection is proposed. A binary tree (BT) threshold filter is designed for the proposed hybrid islanding protection loop, to avoid false detection during other grid operational issues. UL 1741 (section 46) standard is followed for the PV-VSC system to consider the worst-case scenario. Performance of the proposed hybrid islanding protection scheme is investigated for IEEE 9 bus system with multiple DERs, implemented in MATLAB/Simulink environment. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is determined by result analysis, where no significant effect on power quality is recorded during nominal grid operation.

SO INSECT SCIENCE
AB Dialeurolonga malleswaramensis Sundararaj (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) is a phytophagous sap sucking insect. It infests Polyalthia longifolia, an important avenue tree of India, effective in alleviating noise pollution and having immensemedicinal importance. Samples of this insect were collected from Polyalthia longifolia. The cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (mtCO1) helped in the molecular characterization of the insect. This study reports the bacterial diversity in D. malleswaramensis adults by high throughput 16S rDNA amplicon pyrosequencing. The major genera identified were Portiera and Arsenophonus. Other bacterial genera detected were uncultured alpha proteobacterium, Sphingopyxis and Methylobacterium. We also employed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in whole mount samples to confirm the presence of dominant endosymbionts Portiera and Arsenophonus to the bacteriocyte of D. malleswaramensis. This study concludes that combining techniques like 16S rDNA amplicon pyrosequencing and FISH reveal both dominant and rare bacteria. The data also predict the evolutionary position of this pest with respect to other whitefly species using a mitochondrial marker.

TI Optimal and heuristic algorithms for all-optical group multicast in
   resource-constrained WDM networks
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS
AB Given a sparse-splitting wavelength-division multiplexing network with no wavelength converter, we study a group multicast problem that is how to transmit a number of multicast streams from the video server to multiple destinations simultaneously. To avoid the situation that the wavelengths are used up by the first few requests, one wavelength is available for each multicast request. Hence, some of destinations may not be included in the multicast trees because of the lack of wavelengths. Our goal is to construct a number of light trees with conflict-free wavelengths for multiple requests so that the number of served clients is maximized. This problem is named as the revenue-maximized and delay-constrained group multicast routing problem. We first determine a set of multicast trees with the maximum number of served clients, then followed by the wavelength assignment to allocate the minimum number of wavelengths to the resulting trees. In this study, we propose two Integer Linear Programming ILP-based algorithms for determining the optimal solutions for the light-tree construction problem and the wavelength assignment problem, respectively. For large-scale networks, two heuristics are introduced to solve the light-tree construction problem approximately. A set of simulations are also provided for comparing performances of our algorithms against the other published methods. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This paper examines the predictive power of five linear hedonic pricing models for the residential market with varying levels of complexity in their spatial and temporal structures. Unlike similar studies, we extend the out-of-sample forecast evaluation to one-day-ahead predictions with a rolling estimation window, which is a reasonable setting for many practical applications. We show that the in-sample fit and cross-validation prediction accuracy improve significantly when we account for spatial heterogeneity. In particular, for one-day ahead forecasts, the spatiotemporal autoregressive (STAR) model demonstrates its superiority over model specifications with alternating spatial and temporal heterogeneity and dependence structures. In addition, sub-market fixed effects, constructed on the basis of statistical TREE methods, improve the results of predefined local rental markets further.

TI Sustainable Solution for Seawall Protection against Tsunami-Induced
   Damage
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMECHANICS
AB To protect coastal structures from the damage caused by the impact force of a tsunami, a new concept of using waste tires behind such structures is introduced in this paper. A physical model for tsunami impact force simulation was developed to evaluate the reduction effect of tsunami impact force by the tire structures. Model tests also were performed to evaluate the stiffness of tire structures. From an esthetic point of view, cultivation of suitable plants inside the tires is also proposed. Field tests on planting trees that can grow in saline soil conditions were performed to see whether such a structure can preserve the greenery of the area. Results show that the tsunami impact force could be reduced considerably by placing filled tires (with a suitable material) behind seawalls, and this technique can protect the structures from the tsunami impact force and the resulting scouring. The greening effect could be maintained by the appropriate selection of the shrubs and trees planted inside the tires, making it one of the most cost-effective methods for recycling waste tires.

TI Efficient Textual Web Retrieval using Wavelet Tree
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION RETRIEVAL RESEARCH
AB Searching on the web is one of the most progressive and expanding field nowadays. A large amount of information is available on the World Wide Web, motivating the need of efficient text indexing method that support fast text retrieval. In the past, two main indexing techniques: Signature files and Inverted files have been proposed. First require much larger space to store index and are more expensive to construct and update than inverted files. Second has been efficiently implemented using different structures like Sorted array and B-Tree. Sorted array was very expensive in updating the indices while appending a new keyword and B-tree method breaks down if there are many words with the same prefix. This paper presents a modified index structure for text retrieval that keeps a good result to optimize the space needed to store and time to search document. The proposed index is designed using the Wavelet Tree (WT), which was originally designed as wavelet transform for images. Experimental results show that on increasing the query length, the WT based index performs better than others.

TI Demodex treatment in external ocular disease: the outcomes of a
   Tasmanian case series
SO INTERNATIONAL OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB Demodex species (spp.) have previously been implicated in the pathogenesis of blepharitis. This study aims to correlate improvement in symptoms of external ocular disease with treatment of underlying Demodex spp. This is a prospective, observational case series of patients with chronic external ocular disease. Demodicosis was confirmed by microscopic examination of epilated eyelashes. The main outcome measure was response to the treatment (5 % tee tree oil) in regard to change in subjective symptoms utilising a symptom-based patient questionnaire assessment. Overall patients had a good response to the treatment in terms of improvement or resolution of symptoms, with 91 % of patients reporting at least some improvement in symptoms. The treatment of underlying Demodex spp. appears to result in improvement of symptoms in patients with long standing external ocular disease and underlying Demodex spp. infestation.

TI Andean uplift drives diversification of the bothriurid scorpion genus
   Brachistosternus
SO JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY
AB AimOne of the planet's most imposing geomorphological features, the Andes, played an important role in the evolution of South America's flora and fauna. The bothriurid scorpion genus Brachistosternus Pocock, 1893 comprises more than 40 species with high diversity and endemism in the Andes. The present contribution investigates the biogeographical history of this genus using molecular phylogenetics and dating, to determine the role of Andean uplift on the distribution and diversification of its species.
   LocationSouth America.
   MethodsA dated species tree was obtained for 55 putative species based on two nuclear and three mitochondrial gene loci. Ancestral ranges and biogeographical events were estimated on the species tree, diversification rates and rate shifts calculated, and areas with high phylogenetic diversity (PD) and evolutionary distinctiveness identified.
   ResultsBrachistosternus diversified at a steady rate during the main Andean uplift. The central Andean and western slope/Pacific coastal biogeographical provinces played important roles as ancestral areas. Coastal areas of central Chile and southern Peru exhibit high levels of PD in Brachistosternus, suggesting they experienced a relatively long period of ecological stability, while the Andes continued to rise.
   Main conclusionsAndean uplift created new habitats and climate regimes, favouring speciation in genera such as Brachistosternus. Coastal areas to the west of the Andes continued to harbour older lineages while accommodating more recently diverged lineages from the nearby Andes.

TI Uncovering the role of the Western Mediterranean tectonics in shaping
   the diversity and distribution of the trap-door spider genus Ummidia
   (Araneae, Ctenizidae)
SO JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY
AB AimWe test the hypothesis that the opening of the Western Mediterranean basin drove the diversification of the trap-door spider genus Ummidia by reconstructing the phylogeny and inferring a temporal framework of diversification. Additionally, we assess niche interchangeability of three Ummidia species to test the role of dispersal in shaping their present-day distribution.
   LocationWestern Mediterranean, encompassing the known distribution range of Ummidia on the Iberian Peninsula and Northern Africa.
   MethodsWe use multi-locus data and employ both gene concatenation and coalescent species-tree approaches in phylogenetic reconstruction and Bayesian divergence estimation. Species distribution modelling is used to assess the ecological preferences of three species and evaluate ecological interchangeability.
   ResultsThe diversification time frame inferred for the basal split of Ummidia and subsequent diversification correlates with the tectonic movements involved in the phases of the opening of the Western Mediterranean. The basal split (24Ma) correlates with the opening of the Valencia Trough, the split of the Maghrebian clade (16.54Ma) with the separation of the Kabylies and Betic-Rif blocks. A back-colonization of the Iberian Peninsula from northern Africa was detected, presumably occurring via land bridges during the Messinian salinity crisis. The environmental preferences of Ummidia species indicate that U. algarve and adjacent Ummidia sp. Tarifa' are ecologically interchangeable.
   Main conclusionsTectonic movements involved in the opening of the Western Mediterranean shaped the distribution and diversity of extant Mediterranean Ummidia lineages. Despite the putative ability of Ummidia for airborne dispersal, observed phylogeographical patterns and isolation of ecologically interchangeable and geographically proximate species indicate that long-distance dispersal events are rare and the present-day distribution may be due to vicariant events driven by drifting microplates. Finally, several additional evolutionary independent lineages that may correspond to putative new species were detected.

TI Complex niche divergence underlies lineage diversification in Oophaga
   poison frogs
SO JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY
AB AimDespite the incredible diversity of lowland tropical rain forests, we still have limited understanding of the drivers of speciation in these ecoregions. Here, we investigated the relative contribution of geographical and environmental factors to the diversification of a Neotropical genus of poison frogs (Oophaga).
   LocationCentral and South America, including regions from southern Nicaragua to northern Ecuador.
   MethodsWe generated gene genealogies (12S, 16S, COI, CytB and tRNA-val, SIAH1, H3 and Rag1) and used species phylogenetic methods (MDC and *beast) to generate a robust phylogeny of Oophaga frogs. Then, we combined the resulting phylogenetic hypothesis with detailed geographical data and environmental niche modelling (ENM) to test the role of geographical isolation, climatic niche divergence and altitudinal gradients.
   ResultsGene genealogies were discordant and did not show exclusive genealogical patterns; however, species tree resolved the phylogenetic relationship among Oophaga species with strong node support (>0.9 ML/BPP). Geographical ranges showed little overlap between distantly related species. However, within the South American and Central American clades, sister taxa showed substantially overlapping ranges. Analyses of ecological disparity (DTT) indicated a departure from a neutral (Brownian) model of evolution, and age-range correlations, predicted niche occupancy profiles, and Seeva analyses showed that different species tend to evolve under different potential climatic niches.
   Main conclusionsOophaga frogs originated in Central America and reached South America after the closure of the Panama Isthmus. The South- and Central-American clades of this genus have convergently evolved to similar patterns of geographical distribution and niche occupancy. Within clades, sister taxa showed parapatric distributions replacing each other along elevational gradients as predicted by the models of divergence along continuous ecological gradients. Accordingly, we found strong shifts in climatic niches throughout the history of these two clades. However, the largest niche shifts seem to post-date the final elevation of the Talamanca and northern Andes. Overall, our data suggest that speciation along climatic gradients on a structured landscape has been a major evolutionary force behind the diversification of Oophaga poison frogs.

TI A 62-year analysis of historical aerial images showing human impacts on
   beach topography in Hoi Ha Wan Marine Park, Hong Kong. Implications for
   marine park management and sustainability with a changing global climate
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
AB The marine park of Hoi Ha Wan was established in 1996 and functions as a public leisure and educational facility that also protects a rich marine biodiversity. This study examines a sequence of historical aerial images dating back to the 1950s as Hong Kong recovered from World War II. These expose an hitherto unrecognised > 60 year-long pattern of environmental change and, ultimately, decline in head-of-bay beach form related to a variety of long- and short-term anthropogenic-induced impacts upon the village of Hoi Ha and its bay - Hoi Ha Wan. How these perturbations have collectively impacted beach form in Hoi Ha Wan to reduce it to, probably, something like its pre-human and post ice age form is described. The long term consequences of this reduction in beach size will have implications with regard to the sustainability of the marine park itself in the light of continuing infra-structural changes to the surrounding village and country park and in relation to climate change resulting in locally higher temperatures, higher volumes of rainfall and raised sea levels.

TI Probabilistic Fault Diagnosis of Safety Instrumented Systems based on
   Fault Tree Analysis and Bayesian Network
SO JOURNAL OF FAILURE ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION
AB Safety instrumented systems (SISs) are used in the oil and gas industry to detect the onset of hazardous events and/or to mitigate their consequences to humans, assets, and environment. A relevant problem concerning these systems is failure diagnosis. Diagnostic procedures are then required to determine the most probable source of undetected dangerous failures that prevent the system to perform its function. This paper presents a probabilistic fault diagnosis approach of SIS. This is a hybrid approach based on fault tree analysis (FTA) and Bayesian network (BN). Indeed, the minimal cut sets as the potential sources of SIS failure were generated via qualitative analysis of FTA, while diagnosis importance factor of components was calculated by converting the standard FTA in an equivalent BN. The final objective is using diagnosis data to generate a diagnosis map that will be useful to guide repair actions. A diagnosis aid system is developed and implemented under SWI-Prolog tool to facilitate testing and diagnosing of SIS.

TI Wind damage risk estimation for strip cutting under current and future
   wind conditions based on moment observations in a coastal forest in
   Japan
SO JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
AB In Japan, coastal forests have been constructed along the seashore to prevent houses and fields from disasters caused by strong winds. A management method needs to be established to regulate the stand density. There is also the possibility that wind speed will increase in the future because of the increasing strength of tropical cyclones caused by climate change. We evaluated the current and future risk of wind damage associated with strip cutting of Japanese black pine forest based on moment work on sample trees. We established a research site consisting of three groups of trees: group A faced a 1.2-m cutting strip, group B faced a 5-m cutting strip, and group C was the control. Group B was vulnerable to strong winds because the normalized critical wind speed (CWSnml) was significantly smaller than that in the other groups. The damage risk was evaluated by comparing CWSnml with the criterion, a 50-year return period of wind speed. In the current conditions, 5-m cutting had a certain degree of risk, and 1.2-m cutting showed a low risk. Under the future wind conditions, 5-m cutting was found to show high risk so that most of the trees did not meet the criterion. The 1.2-m cutting showed a low risk even in the future conditions. Our results clearly reveal the significant changes in the stability of remaining trees against strong winds after strip cutting. This study suggests a method to quantify the risk involved in forest management.

TI Establishment of a high-frequency regeneration system in Cerasus
   humilis, an important economic shrub
SO JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
AB Cerasus humilis is a species of small, perennial, drought-resistant and multipurpose deciduous shrub grown in arid and semi-arid conditions in northern China. In this study, an efficient protocol for the rapid micropropagation of C. humilis has been standardized using stem and/or leaf explants. Direct multiple shoot induction was observed when the stem explants were cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with different plant growth regulators. The highest shoot induction was obtained when stem explants from adult trees were cultured on MS medium supplemented with 2.0 mg L-1 6-benzyladenine (6-BA) and 0.9 mg L-1 alpha-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA). The leaf and stem explants cultured on MS medium with 1.0 mg L-1 6-BA and 0.6 mg L-1 NAA, and 0.5 mg L-1 6-BA and 0.8 mg L-1 NAA, respectively, produced the highest induction frequency of callus. Maximum proliferation of callus was observed on MS medium containing a combination of 0.5 mg L-1 6-BA with 0.6 mg L-1 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-d). Optimal shoots differentiated from callus were obtained on MS medium supplemented with 5.0mg L-1 6-BA and 0.9 mg L-1 NAA. In vitro rooting was achieved on half-strength (1/2) MS medium containing 0.5 mg L-1 NAA. Rooted plantlets were hardened under control conditions and successfully acclimatized under field conditions.

TI Cesium absorption through bark of Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica)
SO JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
AB Absorption of radiocesium (Cs-137 and Cs-134) through bark, and its subsequent translocation into wood and needles, has been suggested as a potential source of tree contamination, but the process is not well understood. Field experiments were conducted to confirm whether Cs could enter a Japanese cedar tree through the bark and how Cs moves within a tree. Stable Cs (Cs-133) was applied to the bark at 1.2-m height on 10- and 26-year-old Japanese cedars. The Cs-133 concentrations were determined in the bark, sapwood, and heartwood (for 26-year-old cedar only) of stem disks from several heights, as well as in current-year needles from the canopy. The Cs-133 concentrations were considerably higher in the sapwood and heartwood of stem disks from 1.2-m height in treated trees than in untreated trees, suggesting that Cs-133 penetrated the bark to enter the wood. The average Cs-133 concentrations were higher in the heartwood than the sapwood, indicating Cs-133 accumulation in the heartwood. High Cs-133 concentrations in the needles of treated trees implied acropetal movement of Cs-133 to actively growing organs. Our results demonstrate that Cs can enter Japanese cedar trees through the bark and that Cs is transported radially to the heartwood and vertically to the apex.

TI Evaluation of commercial soy sauce koji strains of Aspergillus oryzae
   for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) production
SO JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB In this study, four selected commercial strains of Aspergillus oryzae were collected from soy sauce koji. These A. oryzae strains designated as NSK, NSZ, NSJ and NST shared similar morphological characteristics with the reference strain (A. oryzae FRR 1675) which confirmed them as A. oryzae species. They were further evaluated for their ability to produce gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) by cultivating the spore suspension in a broth medium containing 0.4 % (w/v) of glutamic acid as a substrate for GABA production. The results showed that these strains were capable of producing GABA; however, the concentrations differed significantly (P < 0.05) among themselves. Based on the A. oryzae strains, highest GABA concentration was obtained from NSK (194 mg/L) followed by NSZ (63 mg/L), NSJ (51.53 mg/L) and NST (31.66 mg/L). Therefore, A. oryzae NSK was characterized and the sequence was found to be similar to A. oryzae and A. flavus with 99 % similarity. The evolutionary distance (K (nuc)) between sequences of identical fungal species was calculated and a phylogenetic tree prepared from the K (nuc) data showed that the isolate belonged to the A. oryzae species. This finding may allow the development of GABA-rich ingredients using A. oryzae NSK as a starter culture for soy sauce production.

TI Arcobacter acticola sp nov., isolated from seawater on the East Sea in

SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY
AB A Gram-stain-negative, facultative aerobic, non-flagellated, and rod-shaped bacterium, designated AR-13(T), was isolated from a seawater on the East Sea in South Korea, and subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic study. Strain AR-13(T) grew optimally at 30 degrees C, at pH 7.0-8.0 and in the presence of 0-0.5% (w/v) NaCl. The phylogenetic trees based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain AR-13(T) fell within the Glade comprising the type strains of Arcobacter species, clustering coherently with the type strain of Arcobacter venerupis. Strain AR-13(T) exhibited 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values of 98.1% to the type strain of A. venerupis and of 93.2-96.9% to the type strains of the other Arcobacter species. Strain AR-13(T) contained MK-6 as the only menaquinone and summed feature 3 (C-16:1 omega 7c and/or C-16:1 omega 6c), C-16:0, C-18:1 omega 7c, and summed feature 2 (iso-C-16:1 I and/or C-14:0 3-OH) as the major fatty acids. The major polar lipids detected in strain AR-13(T) were phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and one unidentified aminophospholipid. The DNA G+C content was 28.3 mol% and its mean DNA-DNA relatedness value with the type strain of A. venerupis was 21%. Differential phenotypic properties, together with its phylogenetic and genetic distinctiveness, revealed that strain AR-13(T) is separated from recognized Arcobacter species. On the basis of the data presented, strain AR-13(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Arcobacter, for which the name Arcobacter acticola T. nov. is proposed. The type strain is AR-13(T) (=KCTC 52212(T) =NBRC 112272(T)).

TI Different roles of the small GTPases Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoG in
   CALEB/NGC-induced dendritic tree complexity
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY
AB Rho GTPases play prominent roles in the regulation of cytoskeletal reorganization. Many aspects have been elaborated concerning the individual functions of Rho GTPases in distinct signaling pathways leading to cytoskeletal rearrangements. However, major questions have yet to be answered regarding the integration and the signaling hierarchy of different Rho GTPases in regulating the cytoskeleton in fundamental physiological events like neuronal process differentiation. Here, we investigate the roles of the small GTPases Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoG in defining dendritic tree complexity stimulated by the transmembrane epidermal growth factor family member CALEB/NGC. Combining gain-of-function and loss-of-function analysis in primary hippocampal neurons, we find that Rac1 is essential for CALEB/NGC-mediated dendritic branching. Cdc42 reduces the complexity of dendritic trees. Interestingly, we identify the palmitoylated isoform of Cdc42 to adversely affect dendritic outgrowth and dendritic branching, whereas the prenylated Cdc42 isoform does not. In contrast to Rac1, CALEB/NGC and Cdc42 are not directly interconnected in regulating dendritic tree complexity. Unlike Rac1, the Rac1-related GTPase RhoG reduces the complexity of dendritic trees by acting upstream of CALEB/NGC. Mechanistically, CALEB/NGC activates Rac1, and RhoG reduces the amount of CALEB/NGC that is located at the right site for Rac1 activation at the cell membrane. Thus, Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoG perform very specific and non-redundant functions at different levels of hierarchy in regulating dendritic tree complexity induced by CALEB/NGC.

TI Plasma Alkylresorcinols Reflect Gluten Intake and Distinguish between
   Gluten-Rich and Gluten-Poor Diets in a Population at Risk of Metabolic
   Syndrome
SO JOURNAL OF NUTRITION
AB Background: Many patients with celiac disease experience difficulties in adherence to a gluten-free diet. Methods for testing compliance to a gluten-free diet are costly and cumbersome. Thus, a simple biomarker of gluten intake is needed in a clinical setting and will be useful for epidemiologic studies investigating wider effects of gluten intake.
   Objective: The aim was to evaluate plasma total alkylresorcinol concentrations as a measure of gluten intake.
   Methods: In this randomized, controlled, crossover intervention study in 52 Danish adults with features of the metabolic syndrome, we compared 8 wk of a gluten-rich and gluten-poor diet separated by a washout period of wk. We measured fasting plasma concentrations of alkylresorcinols to determine if they reflected differences in gluten intake as a secondary outcome of the original study. In addition, we investigated in 118 Danish adults the cross-sectional association between self reported gluten intake and plasma alkylresorcinols in the same and a similar study at baseline. We used mixed-model ANCOVA for examining treatment effects, a classification tree to determine compliance to the gluten-poor diet, and linear regression models for examining baseline correlation between plasma alkylresorcinol concentrations and gluten intake.
   Results: Plasma total alkylresorcinols decreased more during the gluten-poor period (geometric mean: -124.8 nmol/L; 95% CI: -156.5, -93.0 nmol/L) than in the gluten-rich period (geometric mean: -31.8 nmol/L; 95% CI: -63.1, -0.4 nmol/L) (P < 0.001). On the basis of the plasma alkylresorcinol profile, we built a classification tree to objectively determine compliance and found an overall participant misclassification error of 3.9%. In the cross-sectional study we found a 5.6% (95% CI: 2.4%, 8.9%) increase in plasma total alkylresorcinols per 1-g increase in reported gluten intake (P < 0.001).
   Conclusion: We propose the use of plasma alkylresorcinols to monitor compliance to a gluten-free diet as well as to help investigations into the possible effects of gluten in the wider population. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT017119913 and NCT01731366.

TI Knot probabilities in random diagrams
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We consider a natural model of random knotting-choose a knot diagram at random from the finite set of diagrams with n crossings. We tabulate diagrams with 10 and fewer crossings and classify the diagrams by knot type, allowing us to compute exact probabilities for knots in this model. As expected, most diagrams with 10 and fewer crossings are unknots (about 78% of the roughly 1.6 billion 10 crossing diagrams). For these crossing numbers, the unknot fraction is mostly explained by the prevalence of 'tree-like' diagrams which are unknots for any assignment of over/under information at crossings. The data shows a roughly linear relationship between the log of knot type probability and the log of the frequency rank of the knot type, analogous to Zipf's law for word frequency. The complete tabulation and all knot frequencies are included as supplementary data.

TI Front tracking of the translocation of water-soluble cesium deposited on
   tree leaves of plum
SO JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY
AB After the trunks of Cryptomeria japonica and Quercus serrata collected from the Fukushima prefecture were soaked in water, approximately 60 % of the radiocesium in the tree trunks was extracted into the water, indicating that the radiocesium in tree trunks mainly exists in a water-soluble form. The front tracking of cesium into the wood from the leaves of trees was carried out after cesium in the water-soluble form was applied to the leaf surfaces. The results demonstrated that cesium translocated from the cesium-bearing leaves, to the branch in contact with the leaves, and then into the trunk in contact with the branch.

TI Scheduling parallel-machine batch operations to maximize on-time
   delivery performance
SO JOURNAL OF SCHEDULING
AB In this paper we study the problem of minimizing total weighted tardiness, a proxy for maximizing on-time delivery performance, on parallel nonidentical batch processing machines. We first formulate the (primal) problem as a nonlinear integer programming model. We then show that the primal problem can be solved exactly by solving a corresponding dual problem with a nonlinear relaxation. Since both the primal and the dual problems are NP-hard, we use genetic algorithms, based on random keys and multiple choice encodings, to heuristically solve them. We find that the genetic algorithms consistently outperform a standard mathematical programming package in terms of solution quality and computation time. We also compare the smaller problem instances to a breadth-first tree search algorithm that gives evidence of the quality of the solutions.

TI Visualizing the World's Scientific Publications
SO JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Automated methods for the analysis, modeling, and visualization of large-scale scientometric data provide measures that enable the depiction of the state of world scientific development. We aimed to integrate minimum span clustering (MSC) and minimum spanning tree methods to cluster and visualize the global pattern of scientific publications (PSP) by analyzing aggregated Science Citation Index (SCI) data from 1994 to 2011. We hypothesized that PSP clustering is mainly affected by countries' geographic location, ethnicity, and level of economic development, as indicated in previous studies. Our results showed that the 100 countries with the highest rates of publications were decomposed into 12 PSP groups and that countries within a group tended to be geographically proximal, ethnically similar, or comparable in terms of economic status. Hubs and bridging nodes in each knowledge production group were identified. The performance of each group was evaluated across 16 knowledge domains based on their specialization, volume of publications, and relative impact. Awareness of the strengths and weaknesses of each group in various knowledge domains may have useful applications for examining scientific policies, adjusting the allocation of resources, and promoting international collaboration for future developments.

TI HIV Maintains an Evolving and Dispersed Population in Multiple Tissues
   during Suppressive Combined Antiretroviral Therapy in Individuals with
   Cancer
SO JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY
AB While combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) can result in undetectable plasma viral loads, it does not eradicate HIV infection. Furthermore, HIV-infected individuals while on cART remain at an increased risk of developing serious comorbidities, such as cancer, neurological disease, and atherosclerosis, suggesting that during cART, tissue-based HIV may contribute to such pathologies. We obtained DNA and RNA env, nef, and pol sequences using single-genome sequencing from postmortem tissues of three HIV+ cART-treated (cART(+)) individuals with undetectable viral load and metastatic cancer at death and performed time-scaled Bayesian evolutionary analyses. We used a sensitive in situ hybridization technique to visualize HIV gag-pol mRNA transcripts in cerebellum and lymph node tissues from one patient. Tissue-associated virus evolved at similar rates in cART(+) and cART-naive (cART(-)) patients. Phylogenetic trees were characterized by two distinct features: (i) branching patterns consistent with constant viral evolution and dispersal among tissues and (ii) very recently derived clades containing both DNA and RNA sequences from multiple tissues. Rapid expansion of virus near death corresponded to wide-spread metastasis. HIV RNA(+) cells clustered in cerebellum tissue but were dispersed in lymph node tissue, mirroring the evolutionary patterns observed for that patient. Activated, infiltrating macrophages were associated with HIV RNA. Our data provide evidence that tissues serve as a sanctuary for wild-type HIV during cART and suggest the importance of macrophages as an alternative reservoir and mechanism of virus spread.
   IMPORTANCE
   Combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) reduces plasma HIV to undetectable levels; however, removal of cART results in plasma HIV rebound, thus highlighting its inability to entirely rid the body of infection. Additionally, HIV-infected individuals on cART remain at high risk of serious diseases, which suggests a contribution from residual HIV. In this study, we isolated and sequenced HIV from postmortem tissues from three HIV+ cART(+) individuals who died with metastatic cancer and had no detectable plasma viral load. Using high-resolution evolutionary analyses, we found that tissue-based HIV continues to replicate, evolve, and migrate among tissues during cART. Furthermore, cancer onset and metastasis coincided with increased HIV expansion, suggesting a linked mechanism. HIV-expressing cells were associated with tissue macrophages, a target of HIV infection. Our results suggest the importance of tissues, and macrophages in particular, as a target for novel anti-HIV therapies.

TI Exploring demographic information in social media for product
   recommendation
SO KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB In many e-commerce Web sites, product recommendation is essential to improve user experience and boost sales. Most existing product recommender systems rely on historical transaction records or Web-site-browsing history of consumers in order to accurately predict online users' preferences for product recommendation. As such, they are constrained by limited information available on specific e-commerce Web sites. With the prolific use of social media platforms, it now becomes possible to extract product demographics from online product reviews and social networks built from microblogs. Moreover, users' public profiles available on social media often reveal their demographic attributes such as age, gender, and education. In this paper, we propose to leverage the demographic information of both products and users extracted from social media for product recommendation. In specific, we frame recommendation as a learning to rank problem which takes as input the features derived from both product and user demographics. An ensemble method based on the gradient-boosting regression trees is extended to make it suitable for our recommendation task. We have conducted extensive experiments to obtain both quantitative and qualitative evaluation results. Moreover, we have also conducted a user study to gauge the performance of our proposed recommender system in a real-world deployment. All the results show that our system is more effective in generating recommendation results better matching users' preferences than the competitive baselines.

TI An efficient pruning strategy for approximate string matching over
   suffix tree
SO KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB Approximate string matching over suffix tree with depth-first search (ASM_ST_DFS), a classical algorithm in the field of approximate string matching, was originally proposed by Ricardo A. Baeza-Yates and Gaston H. Gonnet in 1990. The algorithm is one of the most excellent algorithms for approximate string matching if combined with other indexing techniques. However, its time complexity is sensitive to the length of pattern string because it searches characters on each path from the root before backtracking. In this paper, we propose an efficient pruning strategy to solve this problem. We prove its correctness and efficiency in theory. Particularly, we proved that if the pruning strategy is adopted, it averagely searches O(k) characters on each path before backtracking instead of O(m). Considering each internal node of suffix tree has multiple branches, the pruning strategy should work very well. We also experimentally show that when k is much smaller than m, the efficiency improves hundreds of times, and when k is not much smaller than m, it is still several times faster. This is the first paper that tries to solve the backtracking problem of ASM_ST_DFS in both theory and practice.

TI Roller: a novel approach to Web information extraction
SO KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB The research regarding Web information extraction focuses on learning rules to extract some selected information from Web documents. Many proposals are ad hoc and cannot benefit from the advances in machine learning; furthermore, they are likely to fade away as the Web evolves, and their intrinsic assumptions are not satisfied. Some authors have explored transforming Web documents into relational data and then using techniques that got inspiration from inductive logic programming. In theory, such proposals should be easier to adapt as the Web evolves because they build on catalogues of features that can be adapted without changing the proposals themselves. Unfortunately, they are difficult to scale as the number of documents or features increases. In the general field of machine learning, there are propositio-relational proposals that attempt to provide effective and efficient means to learn from relational data using propositional techniques, but they have seldom been explored regarding Web information extraction. In this article, we present a new proposal called Roller: it relies on a search procedure that uses a dynamic flattening technique to explore the context of the nodes that provide the information to be extracted; it is configured with an open catalogue of features, so that it can adapt to the evolution of the Web; it also requires a base learner and a rule scorer, which helps it benefit from the continuous advances in machine learning. Our experiments confirm that it outperforms other state-of-the-art proposals in terms of effectiveness and that it is very competitive in terms of efficiency; we have also confirmed that our conclusions are solid from a statistical point of view.

TI A high utility itemset mining algorithm based on subsume index
SO KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB High utility itemset mining addresses the limitations of frequent itemset mining by introducing measures of interestingness that reflect the significance of an itemset beyond its frequency of occurrence. Among such algorithms, level-wise candidate generation-and-test approaches suffer from the drawbacks of having an immense candidate pool and requiring several database scans. Meanwhile, methods based on pattern growth tend to consume large amounts of memory to store conditional trees. We propose an efficient algorithm, called Index High Utility Itemsets Mine (IHUI-Mine), for application to high utility itemsets. The subsume index, which has been employed to mine frequent itemsets, is extended in IHUI-Mine to the discovery of high utility itemsets. In addition to the enumeration and search strategies inherited from the subsume index, we introduce a new property to specifically accelerate the computation of transaction-weighted utilization for high utility itemsets. Furthermore, given that bitmaps are used for database representation, the real utility of candidates can be verified from the recorded transactions rather than by resorting to the entire database. The computational complexity of IHUI-Mine is analyzed, and tests conducted on publicly available synthetic and real datasets further demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms.

TI Set containment join revisited
SO KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB Given two collections of set objects R and S, the set containment join returns all object pairs such that . Besides being a basic operator in all modern data management systems with a wide range of applications, the join can be used to evaluate complex SQL queries based on relational division and as a module of data mining algorithms. The state-of-the-art algorithm for set containment joins () builds an inverted index on the right-hand collection S and a prefix tree on the left-hand collection R that groups set objects with common prefixes and thus, avoids redundant processing. In this paper, we present a framework which improves in two directions. First, we limit the prefix tree construction by proposing an adaptive methodology based on a cost model; this way, we can greatly reduce the space and time cost of the join. Second, we partition the objects of each collection based on their first contained item, assuming that the set objects are internally sorted. We show that we can process the partitions and evaluate the join while building the prefix tree and the inverted index progressively. This allows us to significantly reduce not only the join cost, but also the maximum memory requirements during the join. An experimental evaluation using both real and synthetic datasets shows that our framework outperforms by a wide margin.

TI New insights into the history of domesticated and wild apricots and its
   contribution to Plum pox virus resistance
SO MOLECULAR ECOLOGY
AB Studying domesticated species and their wild relatives allows understanding of the mechanisms of population divergence and adaptation, and identifying valuable genetic resources. Apricot is an important fruit in the Northern hemisphere, where it is threatened by the Plum pox virus (PPV), causing the sharka disease. The histories of apricot domestication and of its resistance to sharka are however still poorly understood. We used 18 microsatellite markers to genotype a collection of 230 wild trees from Central Asia and 142 cultivated apricots as representatives of the worldwide cultivated apricot germplasm; we also performed experimental PPV inoculation tests. The genetic markers revealed highest levels of diversity in Central Asian and Chinese wild and cultivated apricots, confirming an origin in this region. In cultivated apricots, Chinese accessions were differentiated from more Western accessions, while cultivated apricots were differentiated from wild apricots. An approximate Bayesian approach indicated that apricots likely underwent two independent domestication events, with bottlenecks, from the same wild population. Central Asian native apricots exhibited genetic subdivision and high frequency of resistance to sharka. Altogether, our results contribute to the understanding of the domestication history of cultivated apricot and point to valuable genetic diversity in the extant genetic resources of wild apricots.

TI Tests of species-specific models reveal the importance of drought in
   postglacial range shifts of a Mediterranean-climate tree: insights from
   integrative distributional, demographic and coalescent modelling and ABC
   model selection
SO MOLECULAR ECOLOGY
AB Past climate change has caused shifts in species distributions and undoubtedly impacted patterns of genetic variation, but the biological processes mediating responses to climate change, and their genetic signatures, are often poorly understood. We test six species-specific biologically informed hypotheses about such processes in canyon live oak (Quercus chrysolepis) from the California Floristic Province. These hypotheses encompass the potential roles of climatic niche, niche multidimensionality, physiological trade-offs in functional traits, and local-scale factors (microsites and local adaptation within ecoregions) in structuring genetic variation. Specifically, we use ecological niche models (ENMs) to construct temporally dynamic landscapes where the processes invoked by each hypothesis are reflected by differences in local habitat suitabilities. These landscapes are used to simulate expected patterns of genetic variation under each model and evaluate the fit of empirical data from 13 microsatellite loci genotyped in 226 individuals from across the species range. Using approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), we obtain very strong support for two statistically indistinguishable models: a trade-off model in which growth rate and drought tolerance drive habitat suitability and genetic structure, and a model based on the climatic niche estimated from a generic ENM, in which the variables found to make the most important contribution to the ENM have strong conceptual links to drought stress. The two most probable models for explaining the patterns of genetic variation thus share a common component, highlighting the potential importance of seasonal drought in driving historical range shifts in a temperate tree from a Mediterranean climate where summer drought is common.

TI Genome-wide bioinformatics analysis of Dof transcription factor gene
   family of chickpea and its comparative phylogenetic assessment with
   Arabidopsis and rice
SO PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION
AB The genome mining of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) revealed a total of 37 putative Dof genes using NCBI BLAST search against the genome with a highly conserved Dof domain. The translated Dof proteins possessed 150-493 amino acid residues with molecular weight ranging from 16.9 to 54.4 kD and pI varied from 4.98 to 9.64 as revealed by ExPASy server ProtParam. The exon-intron organization showed predominance of intronless Dof genes in chickpea. The predicted Dof genes were distributed among the eight chromosomes with a maximum of 9 Dof genes present on chromosome 7 and a single Dof gene was found on chromosome 8.The predominance of segmental gene duplication as compared to tandem duplication was observed which might be the prime cause of Dof gene family expansion in chickpea. The cis-regulatory element analysis revealed the presence of light-responsive, hormone-responsive, endosperm-specific, meristem-specific and stress-responsive elements. Comprehensive phylogenetic analyses of Dof genes of chickpea with Arabidopsis, rice, soybean and pigeonpea revealed several orthologs and paralogs assisting in understanding the putative functions of CaDof genes. The functional divergence and site-specific selective pressures of chickpea Dof genes have been investigated. The bioinformatics-based genome-wide assessment of Dof gene family of chickpea attempted in the present study could be a significant step for deciphering novel Dof genes based on genome-wide expression profiling.

TI Evolutionary relationships in the genus Secale revealed by DArTseq DNA
   polymorphism
SO PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION
AB Till this day, there is not much known about the phylogeny of the Secale genus; therefore, in our research, we tried to shed some lights on the issue of rye (Secale genus) taxonomy. The genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships were evaluated using 13,842 DArTseq (TM) polymorphic markers. The model-based clustering (STRUCTURE software) separated our 84 samples into three main clusters: perennial cluster, annual cluster, and S. sylvestre cluster. The same result was obtained using Neighbour Joining tree and self-organizing maps. Secale sylvestre, S. strictum, and S. cereale are the three main species of the Secale genus. Three samples of rye are in basal positions in phylogenetic trees. These accessions share ancient morphological characters and are probably the ancestors of different lineages within Secale. Annual Secale taxa, with the exception of S. sylvestre, create one mutual taxon. We have found out that the semi-perennial taxa of S. cereale var. multicaule and S. strictum subsp. ciliatoglume are genetically closest to the annual species of S. cereale. Phylogenetic signals for semi-perennial and annual taxa are also present in S. strictum subsp. africanum. SNP-based analysis revealed that evolution of annual S. cereale has already begun in S. strictum subsp. africanum. The results showed that S. vavilovii cannot be considered as a separate species but a subspecies of S. cereale Secale cereale subsp. dighoricum is a hybrid. It is still not clear whether we can consider S. strictum subsp. strictum and S. strictum subsp. kuprijanovii as two separate species.

TI Detecting east-west genetic differentiation in Castanopsis (Fagaceae) on
   the main islands of Japan and north-south on the Ryukyu Islands, based
   on chloroplast haplotypes
SO PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION
AB Castanopsis (Fagaceae) is a plant genus that includes dominant tree species in the broadleaved evergreen forests of Japan. In this study, we investigated the genetic diversity and genetic structure of 76 natural populations of C. sieboldii and C. cuspidata, using variations in chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) sequences and chloroplast microsatellites (cpSSR) to elucidate the phylogeographic patterns reflected by seed flow. Most chloroplast haplotypes were shared between the two species on the main islands, although biparentally inherited microsatellite (nSSR) analyses showed a species-specific pattern in the previous study. The current patterns of haplotype sharing of cpDNA suggest the retention of an ancestral polymorphism that existed in Castanopsis before the two species split or historical introgression in the refugia during the glacial periods. Haplotype network was defined by three groups: Taiwan, southern parts of the Ryukyu Islands, and the central parts of the Ryukyu Islands to the main islands. The observed north-south genetic differentiation in cpDNA on the Ryukyu Islands was not detected by previous nSSR analyses. These results suggest that the lower levels of seed-mediated gene flow between the islands resulted in clear genetic differentiation of cpDNA on the Ryukyu Islands. Moreover, the cpSSR analysis indicated east-west genetic differentiation on the main islands, a pattern found in previous nSSR analyses of Castanopsis and several plant and animal species inhabiting Castanopsis forests in Japan, suggesting the existence of eastern refugia in the last glacial period. Our cpSSR investigation and their higher intraspecific variation provide a useful phylogeographic tool for these species.

TI Vertical bipedal locomotion in wild bearded capuchin monkeys (Sapajus

SO PRIMATES
AB When carrying objects, nonhuman primates often show bipedal locomotion. Studies of primate bipedality, however, in both nature and captivity, have concentrated on locomotion on horizontal substrates, either terrestrially or arboreally. No observational or experimental study seems to have looked at non-horizontal bipedality, yet we show here that it occurs often in nature in Sapajus libidinosus, the bearded capuchin monkey. The context is transport of small food items from source to site of consumption, in which the monkeys usually carry handfuls of maize kernels over several meters' distance, both on the ground and in the trees. Most impressively, over a fifth of such bouts are done vertically, when the tree trunk is fully upright. Such vertical bipedality, with or without transport, apparently has not been reported before.

TI The hull process of the Brownian plane
SO PROBABILITY THEORY AND RELATED FIELDS
AB We study the random metric space called the Brownian plane, which is closely related to the Brownian map and is conjectured to be the universal scaling limit of many discrete random lattices such as the uniform infinite planar triangulation. We obtain a number of explicit distributions for the Brownian plane. In particular, we consider, for every , the hull of radius r, which is obtained by "filling in the holes" in the ball of radius r centered at the root. We introduce a quantity which is interpreted as the (generalized) length of the boundary of the hull of radius r. We identify the law of the process as the time-reversal of a continuous-state branching process starting from at time and conditioned to hit 0 at time 0, and we give an explicit description of the process of hull volumes given the process . We obtain an explicit formula for the Laplace transform of the volume of the hull of radius r, and we also determine the conditional distribution of this volume given the length of the boundary. Our proofs involve certain new formulas for super-Brownian motion and the Brownian snake in dimension one, which are of independent interest.

TI Scaling limit of the loop-erased random walk Green's function
SO PROBABILITY THEORY AND RELATED FIELDS
AB We consider loop-erased random walk (LERW) running between two boundary points of a square grid approximation of a planar simply connected domain. The LERW Green's function is the probability that the LERW passes through a given edge in the domain. We prove that this probability, multiplied by the inverse mesh size to the power 3/4, converges in the lattice size scaling limit to (a constant times) an explicit conformally covariant quantity which coincides with the Green's function. The proof does not use SLE techniques and is based on a combinatorial identity which reduces the problem to obtaining sharp asymptotics for two quantities: the loop measure of random walk loops of odd winding number about a branch point near the marked edge and a "spinor" observable for random walk started from one of the vertices of the marked edge.

TI A new encoding of coalescent processes: applications to the additive and
   multiplicative cases
SO PROBABILITY THEORY AND RELATED FIELDS
AB We revisit the discrete additive and multiplicative coalescents, starting with n particles with unit mass. These cases are known to be related to some "combinatorial coalescent processes": a time reversal of a fragmentation of Cayley trees or a parking scheme in the additive case, and the random graph process in the multiplicative case. Time being fixed, encoding these combinatorial objects in real-valued processes indexed by the line is the key to describing the asymptotic behaviour of the masses as . We propose to use the Prim order on the vertices instead of the classical breadth-first (or depth-first) traversal to encode the combinatorial coalescent processes. In the additive case, this yields interesting connections between the different representations of the process. In the multiplicative case, it allows one to answer to a stronger version of an open question of Aldous (Ann Probab 25:812-854, 1997): we prove that not only the sequence of (rescaled) masses, seen as a process indexed by the time , converges in distribution to the reordered sequence of lengths of the excursions above the current minimum of a Brownian motion with parabolic drift , but we also construct a version of the standard augmented multiplicative coalescent of Bhamidi et al. (Probab Theory Relat, 2013) using an additional Poisson point process.

TI Molecular Cloning and Characterization of a Novel 4-Aminobutyrate
   Transaminase cDNA from the Monascus ruber Mr-5
SO RESEARCH JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB A full-length cDNA encoding 4-aminobutyrate transaminase (designated as MrGABA-T) which catalyzes the conversion of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to succinic semialdehyde, was isolated from the GABA-rich Monascus ruber Mr-5. The full-length cDNA of MrGABA-T has a 1563 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a protein of 520 amino acid residues. The deduced protein has an isoelectric point (pI) of 9.12 and a calculated molecular weight of 57.5 kDa. Phylogenetic tree analysis reveals that MrGABA-T is more closely related to GABA-Ts from Aspergillus than to those of other fungi.
   In this study, the function of MrGABA-T, a gene regulating GABA production, was also analyzed by the disruption of MrGABA-T in M. ruber Mr-5. The results revealed that the GABA maximum production of MrGABA-T-deleted strain (Delta MrGABA-T) was about 2.8-fold as that of M. ruber Mr-5 (2.67 g/L). This work will make a contribution to enhance GABA production at the molecular level in M. ruber.

TI Isolation and characterization of citrate synthase gene CaCTS in pepper
   cytoplasmic male sterility
SO RESEARCH JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB In the present study, pepper citrate synthase (CaCTS) gene was cloned and characterized. This novel gene was then deposited into NCBI database and assigned to accession number JN885193. The results of cDNA sequences of the pepper CaCTS gene demonstrated that it is a gene with a complete open reading frame of 1413 bp encoding a CaCTS protein of 470 amino acids with a molecular weight of 52.466 kDa and pI of 7.26. Similarly comparisons for amino acid sequences reveal that the pepper CaCTS protein has high homology with the CTS proteins of six other species. The phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that the pepper CaCTS protein has a closer genetic relationship with the CTS protein of Solanum lycopersicum and Nicotiana tabacum than with those of Cucumis sativus, Theobroma cacao, Rhododendron micranthum and Populus trichocarpa.
   Real-time PCR analysis shows that pepper CaCTS gene is expressed in various tissues but at different levels. CaCTS mRNA was highly expressed in flower and seed, moderately expressed in placenta and pericarp, weakly expressed in root, stem and leaf. Transcriptional analysis of the CaCTS gene by qRT-PCR revealed that the gene expression in anthers of the CMS line was clearly lower than in the maintainer at the stages 2 and 3 but no significant differences in the stages 1 and 4.

TI Molecular cloning and expression analysis on a new putative
   antimicrobial peptide gene encoding a defensin like protein from Allium
   cepa L.
SO RESEARCH JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB Onion (Allium cepa L.) is a vegetable plant which has the potential to become medicinal plant due to its high level of antimicrobial peptide content. A full - length cDNA encoding defensin-like protein (designated as AcD) was isolated from onion (Allium cepa L.) by RT-PCR and RACE techniques. The full - length of the putative AcD was 509 bp containing 231 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polypeptide of 76 amino acids. Comparative and bioinformatic analyses revealed that AcD showed extensive homology with defensin genes from other fungi species. The deduced 77 amino acid sequence showed a high homology with the defensin-like proteins, also known as antimicrobial peptides from the other plant species.
   Phylogenetic tree analysis indicated that AcD belonged to the fungi group and had close relationship with the defensin-like protein from Carnobacterium divergens. Tissue expression pattern analysis using the method of quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) indicated that the putative AcD was constitutively expressed in all the tested tissues and strongly in the leaves, weak in the roots. The putative AcD was found to be an elicitor-responsive gene which could be induced by exogenous elicitors including Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The transcript levels of AcD were up-regulated after treated by Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli in the leaves, but not in the roots. These results would help to understand the role of the putative antimicrobial peptide gene, AcD, in Allium cepa L.

TI A fast algorithm for constructing nearly optimal prefix codes
SO SOFTWARE-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
AB Huffman algorithm allows for constructing optimal prefix-codes with O(n<bold>logn</bold>) complexity. As the number of symbols ngrows, so does the complexity of building the code-words. In this paper, a new algorithm and implementation are proposed that achieve nearly optimal coding without sorting the probabilities or building a tree of codes. The complexity is proportional to the maximum code length, making the algorithm especially attractive for large alphabets. The focus is put on achieving almost optimal coding with a fast implementation, suitable for real-time compression of large volumes of data. A practical case example about checkpoint files compression is presented, providing encouraging results. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Importance of tree height and social position for drought-related stress
   on tree growth and mortality
SO TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
AB A higher mortality of dominant trees under drought stress is explained by impacts of tree size, canopy- and root structure and the hydraulic transport system.
   Drought stress can trigger tree mortality but the impact depends on stress intensity (water demand and availability) and on the vulnerability of the individual. Therefore, most research focusses on the species-specific properties such as water use efficiency or hydraulic conductivity that determine vulnerability. At the ecosystem scale, however, tree properties that have been found important for drought sensitivity or resistance vary with individual size and resource availability within a forest-also within the same species. This is caused by different environmental conditions for each tree and hence different growth histories of individuals generating specific anatomical and physiological features. Individual drought stress sensitivity might thus be considerably different from stand scale sensitivity. Indeed, empirical evidence shows that drought stress impact depends on tree social position which can be defined in degrees of suppression but correlated to resource availability, stress sensitivity and stress exposure. In this review, we collect such evidence and discuss the role of microclimate and soil water distribution as well as anatomical and physiological adjustments, which might serve as foundation for better-adapted management strategies to mitigate drought stress impacts. Finally, we define model requirements aiming to capture stand-scale drought responses or management impacts related to drought stress mitigation.

TI Genetic diversity and population structure of Melia azedarach in
   North-Western Plains of India
SO TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
AB Genetic structure among M. azedarach populations was detected and two subpopulations were present among them. A significant 'isolation by distance' was found in M. azedarach population in North-Western Plains of India.
   Melia azedarach is an important forest tree with pharmaceutical, insecticidal, pesticidal, and commercial significance. It is a good reforestation tree because of its fast growth and drought hardy nature. Genetic variation in a species allows itself to adapt, evolve and respond to environmental stress. It provides the basis for survival of a species and critically influences its evolutionary potential. Assessment of genetic diversity is necessary for improvement and conservation of a species. For this, microsatellite markers are of particular interest given the attributes like co-dominance, reproducibility, hyper variability and abundance throughout the genome. In the present study, we analyzed the genetic diversity and population structure of M. azedarach, an ecologically imperative species growing in the North-Western Plains of India. We developed 43 microsatellite markers, of which 20 were subsequently employed for analysis of diversity and population structure among 33 populations encompassing 318 genotypes representing North-Western Plains of India. A moderate level of diversity (Na = 5.1, Ho = 0.506, He = 0.712, I = 1.386) was assessed. The highest value of Delta K estimated using STRUCTURE indicated 2 subpopulations (K = 2). AMOVA exhibited 73 % variation within populations and 12 % variation was found among regions. Significant positive correlation between geographical and genetic distance was found (Rxy = 0.365, P = 0.010). The present study lays a foundation on a better understanding of genetic dynamics of the species and reveals its diversity and population structure in North-Western Plains of India.

TI Periodicity and environmental drivers of apical and lateral growth in a
   Cerrado woody species
SO TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
AB Apical and lateral growth are seasonal in a Cerrado species, and these events are related to each other and linked with climatic and environmental features.
   In the Cerrado, a tropical ecosystem with seasonal rainfall, we investigated the timing of leaf production and cambial activity, and checked whether these features are related to each other and with climatic and environmental factors. Between September 2011 and December 2012, sampling of main stem and vegetative phenological observations of Kielmeyera grandiflora (Wawra) Saddi (Calophyllaceae) were done monthly to assess seasonality in leaf production and cambial activity, and to compare these features with each other. To check the relationship of bud opening and the onset of cambial activity with climatic and environmental features, the average temperature and day length, and the precipitation sum in a time window ranging from 1 to 30 days before the occurrence of these events were recorded, and the coefficient of variation was calculated. Leaf production and cambial activity were seasonal. Bud opening occurred in September 2011 and August 2012, during the dry season. The onset of cambial activity occurred in October both in 2011 and 2012, 1-2 months after bud opening, at the beginning of the rainy season. The cambium was dormant in May, during the rainy season. Photoperiod and temperature showed low coefficients of variation in the time window before bud opening and onset of cambial activity, while rainfall presented a high coefficient of variation. Thus, both apical and lateral growth are seasonal events in Cerrado species, and are related to each other. A set of climatic and environmental features is related with seasonal growth, among which photoperiod and temperature may be important in the regulation of these events.

TI Tree growth, cambial phenology, and wood anatomy of limber pine at a
   Great Basin (USA) mountain observatory
SO TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
AB Anatomical features of Pinus flexilis under warmer and drier conditions along an altitudinal transect revealed a shorter growing season and shifts in the timing of wood formation.
   Future climate change driven by greenhouse warming is expected to increase both frequency and severity of drought events and heat waves. Possible consequences for forest ecosystems include changes in foundation species and extended die-off phenomena. We investigated tree growth under the set of biotic and abiotic conditions, and their interactions, that are expected in a drier and warmer world using mountain observatories designed to capture elevation gradients in the Great Basin of North America. Stem cambial activity, wood anatomy, and radial growth of limber pine (Pinus flexilis) were examined at two different elevations using automated dendrometers and repeated histological microcores in 2013-2014. Mean annual temperature was 3.7A degrees cooler at the higher site, which received 170 mm year(-1) of precipitation more than the lower site. Mean air temperature thresholds for xylogenesis computed using logistic regression were 7.7 and 12.0 A degrees C at the higher and lower site, respectively. No differences in the onset date of cambial activity were found under such naturally contrasted conditions, with the global change analog provided by the lower site. Growing season was shortened by increasing drought stress at the lower site, thereby reducing xylem production. Stem expansion was only detectable by automated dendrometers at the higher site. Using elevation to simulate climatic changes and their realized ecosystem feedbacks, it was possible to express tree responses in terms of xylem phenology and anatomical adaptations.

TI Leaf flushing and shedding, bud and flower production, and stem
   elongation in tall birch trees subjected to increases in aboveground
   temperature
SO TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
AB Tall birch trees allocate extra resource due to aboveground temperature elevation to bud and male flower production rather than to plant growth. Saplings increased only plant growth under warming. Size-dependent response should be considered.
   We experimentally heated canopy organs of tall birch trees (Betula ermanii Cham.; 18-20 m high) growing at a high latitude to determine how leaf phenology, plant growth, and bud and male flower production might shift in response to increases in aboveground temperature during global climate change. We warmed the canopies with infrared heat lamps fixed to steel pipe scaffolds built around the trees. The temperature of the warmed canopies increased by approximately 1 A degrees C. Warming extended the length of the growing season of canopy leaves (by accelerating leaf flush and delaying leaf fall), and significantly increased the numbers of buds and male flowers per shoot. Bud production and shoot length were positively correlated in both warmed and control branches. However, warming did not increase canopy shoot lengths. The intercept value of the positive regression slope between bud production and shoot length for warmed branches was higher than that for control branches. Thus, canopy warming had a direct positive effect on the bud production but had no indirect effect via increases in shoot length. Our experiment showed that tall birch trees allocated extra resources made available by increased aboveground temperature to bud and male flower production rather than to plant growth.

TI Recovery after defoliation in Eucalyptus globulus saplings: respiration
   and growth
SO TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
AB Recovery after partial defoliation and/or debudding treatments was found to be more closely related to the release of latent buds rather than temporal changes in leaf-level respiration and carbon uptake.
   Despite the importance of respiration in the overall carbon balance of plants, recovery after defoliation and debudding has been largely related to changes in carbon uptake; the significance of respiration has received much less attention. Growth, biomass and leaf-level carbon balance (both photosynthesis and dark respiration at night) responses of young Eucalyptus globulus potted-saplings to debudding (B), partial defoliation (D) and combined B&D treatments were assessed over a 12-week recovery period. Light-saturated photosynthetic rates (A (1500)) were asynchronous with night respiration rates (R (dark)) throughout the course of the experiment; 5 weeks after defoliation, significant increases in A (1500) were accompanied by concomitant increases in R (dark) in the B&D and B and D treatments. By week 8, while A (1500) returned to control values, R (dark) had increased, particularly in the B&D treatment. Saplings in the B and D treatments showed full recovery with growth, biomass and leaf area being similar to control saplings by week 12. In contrast, saplings in the B&D treatment appeared unable to compensate for the combined removal of all buds and 35 % leaf area as evidenced by slowed height increments and reductions in total biomass of > 30 %. Simple modelling of whole-plant net CO2 uptake showed that saplings in the B&D treatment fixed 20 % less CO2 than the other treatments at week 12, suggesting that recovery following this treatment and the D treatment was dependent on changes in total leaf area development and whole-tree assimilation rather than differences in assimilation or respiration per unit foliage area. Increased biomass allocation to bud in weeks 5 and 8 suggested that the pattern of refoliation after defoliation and debudding was related to changes in tree architecture from the release of latent buds.

TI Response of tree growth and wood structure of Larix kaempferi, Kalopanax
   septemlobus and Betula platyphylla saplings to elevated CO2
   concentration for 5 years exposure in a FACE system
SO TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
AB Elevated CO (2) concentration affected biomass partitioning in above-ground biomass, but size and number of water-conducting cells were unchanged in Larix kaempferi, Kalopanax septemlobus and Betula platyphylla.
   Using a Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) system, we studied the effect of elevated CO2 on the growth, leaf gas exchange and xylem anatomy of a conifer, Larix kaempferi, and two angiospermous tree species, Kalopanax septemlobus and Betula platyphylla. Two-year-old seedlings were grown at control sites (ambient; 370 ppm) and FACE sites (elevated; 500 ppm) for 5 years. We measured the lumen area and number of water-conducting cells, as well as biomass and leaf gas exchange, and visualized the functional region of water transport using a dye injection experiment. Elevated CO2 did not induce any significant changes in growth or in leaf gas exchange or lumen area of earlywood tracheids in L. kaempferi relative to ambient CO2. In two other tree species, elevated CO2 was found to enhance tree height and total leaf area (LA), with no change in stomatal conductance. In K. septemlobus, there were no changes in lumen area or number of earlywood vessels, or in the functional region of water transport. B. platyphylla also underwent no changes in lumen area or number of vessels, although there was a yearly variation in the size of the vessels. Our results show that 5 years of CO2 exposure did not notably affect the anatomical features of water-conducting cells. This finding suggests that, under elevated CO2, trees respond to changes in water balance due to changes in LA by extending the hydraulically active area of xylem.

TI Regional chronologies of Cedrela fissilis and Cedrela angustifolia in
   three forest types and their relation to climate
SO TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
AB Although tree-ring chronologies of Cedrela fissilis and Cedrela angustifolia showed a common climatic signal, local conditions influence growth, suggesting that forest guidelines should be appropriate to the species and context.
   Cedrela species are highly valued because of the quality of their timber. Understanding the behaviour of each different Cedrela species and their ecology is of importance to ensuring that forest harvesting and management do not endanger the survival of natural populations. These species grow in a wide range of environmental gradients and different types of forests in Bolivia. This study used dendrochronological methods to analyse growth-precipitation relationships of two Cedrela species coming from three locations with different environmental conditions: dry Chiquitano (Concepcin), Chiquitano transitional Amazonian (Guarayos), and Bolivian-Tucuman montane forests (Postrervalle). The rainy season in all locations runs from October to April and the dry season runs from May to September. Twelve Cedrela fissilis specimens were sampled from dry Chiquitano, 11 Cedrela fissilis specimens from Chiquitano transitional Amazonian, and 30 Cedrela angustifolia specimens from Bolivian-Tucuman montane forests. The samples were crossdated and exhibited a common signal between trees from three sites, despite tree rings from the Chiquitano transitional Amazonian forest being narrower and displaying blurred bands of parenchyma in the boundaries. Significant inter-series correlation was found for the C. fissilis species series from dry Chiquitano with r = 0.261 (p < 0.01) and Chiquitano transitional Amazonian forests with r = 0.284 (p < 0.01), and for Cedrela angustifolia from Bolivian-Tucuman montane forests with r = 0.374 (p < 0.01). Mean annual growth was 2.07, 1.92, and 2.82 mm year(-1) at the three sites, respectively. Cedrela species from dry Chiquitano and Bolivian-Tucuman montane forests were sensitive to precipitation from October to April of the current growth year (wettest season) and to low temperatures from May to July of the current growth year (driest season). Samples from Chiquitano transitional Amazonian were more sensitive to precipitation during late rainy season (March, April, and May of the current growth year) and high temperatures during the rainy months (November-December). Growth differences between sites and species in response to climate variations and local conditions should be taken into account and handled with different forest management guidelines.

TI Relationship between the earlywood-to-latewood transition and changes in
   levels of stored starch around the cambium in locally heated stems of
   the evergreen conifer Chamaecyparis pisifera
SO TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
AB We observed the formation of latewood tracheids with narrow diameters and thick walls and the disappearance of stored starch around the cambium on the locally heated region of stems in evergreen conifer Chamaecyparis pisifera during winter cambial dormancy.
   Wood formation is controlled by cambial cell division, which determines the quantity and quality of wood. We investigated the factors that control cambial activity and the formation of new tracheids in locally heated stems of the evergreen conifer Chamaecyparis pisifera. Electric heating tape was wrapped around one side of the stem, at breast height, of two trees in 2013 and two in 2014. Pairs of stems were locally heated in winter, and small blocks were collected from heated and non-heated regions of stems. Cambial activity and levels of stored starch around the cambium were investigated by microscopy. Cambial reactivation and xylem differentiation occurred earlier in heated than in non-heated regions. New cell plates were formed after 14-18 days of heating. After a few layers of tracheids with large diameters and thin walls had formed, cell division and cell enlargement during differentiation were inhibited. Tracheids with narrow diameters and thick walls, defining those as latewood, were formed near the cambium, and finally, four to six layers of tracheids were induced. After cambial reactivation, amounts of stored starch started to decrease and starch disappeared completely from phloem and xylem cells that were located near the cambium during the differentiation of heated regions. Our results suggest that an increase in temperature induces the conversion of stored starch to soluble sugars for continuous cambial cell division and earlywood formation. By contrast, a shortage of stored starch might be responsible for inhibition of cambial activity and induction of the formation of latewood tracheids.

TI Growth trends and climate responses of Norway spruce along elevational
   gradients in East-Central Europe
SO TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
AB Decadal growth variability of Norway spruce increases with elevation. Recent temperature sensitivity and growth enhancement are limited to trees growing in the zone adjacent to timberline.
   Growth trends and climate responses of forest trees along elevational gradients are not fully understood. A deeper insight is, however, fundamental for predicting ecosystem functioning and productivity under future climate change. Supplementary to the effects of elevation and regional provenance on tree growth are sample depth, uneven representation of sample age and varying site conditions. Furthermore, there is only a limited number of studies addressing growth changes along elevational gradients, while at the same time applying tree-ring standardization methods that are sensitive to trend preservation. Here, we introduce 12 novel tree-ring width chronologies of Norway spruce (Picea abies[L.] Karst.) from four elevational belts encompassing montane forests and the local timberline in three regions in East-Central Europe between 15A degrees and 19A degrees E. Each chronology is characterized by sufficient sample replication and a comparable age structure between 1906 and 2010. Tree growth near timberline revealed substantial medium-frequency variability and sharply increasing ring widths since the 1980s. Medium-frequency growth variability of lower elevation trees was, however, relatively small, and growth rates over the last decade were either stable or even decreased. During the last four decades, Norway spruce from higher elevations exhibited a reduced response to autumn temperatures preceding ring formation. In contrast, trees from the lower-montane zone increased their sensitivity to drought during the same time. Our results emphasize not only different but also instable growth trends and climate responses of forest trees along altitudinal gradients, which should be considered in future forest management strategies.

TI De novo transcriptome analysis reveals tissue-specific differences in
   gene expression in Salix arbutifolia
SO TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
AB Transcriptome of five tissues revealed tissue - specific differences in gene expression in Salix arbutifolia, which provides valuable information and sequence resources for identifying the DEGs in willow.
   Salix arbutifolia Pallas is an ancient tree that occupies the basal position in the Salicaceae phylogeny. It is a riparian dioecious tree species distributed in northeastern Asia. Currently, there are no transcriptomic data available that can be used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in different tissues of S. arbutifolia. Here, the RNA-seq analysis results of transcriptome data are reported using Illumina deep sequencing of five tissues from S. arbutifolia. De novo gene assembly was used to generate the consensus transcriptome, and over 25,529,018 high-quality reads were obtained for each library, with 75.97 GB clean data with a Q30 greater than 87.93 %. Here, 60,012 unigenes with an average length of 918 bp were obtained. Comparison of transcriptomes combined with quantitative real-time PCR from the Salix libraries showed that DEGs are mainly functional in photosynthesis, phenylalanine metabolism, glycolysis, and gluconeogenesis. The current global gene expression profiling exercise gives a comprehensive view of the transcriptome and provides valuable information and sequence resources for identifying the DEGs in S. arbutifolia. Moreover, the transcriptome data provide a basis for future study of genetic resistance in Salix.

TI Modulation of antioxidant enzymes in Juniperus procera needles in
   relation to habitat environment and dieback incidence
SO TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
AB Oxidative stress and the antioxidant enzymes' activity are higher in damaged than in healthy Juniperus procera trees, in summer than in winter, and in dry than in wet condition.
   Many of the small stands of Juniperus procera in Saudi Arabia, confined mainly to Aseer Mountains in the southern part of the country, are suffering from branch dieback. As a part of the project on the structural and functional responses of healthy and dieback-affected trees to local environmental conditions of Al-Ghalab, Al-Yazeed, and Saodah locations, this study quantifies the oxidative stress generated and the consequent modulation of proline accumulation and antioxidant enzymes' activity, as determined by chemical analysis of needle tissues from samples collected in summer and winter seasons. The level of TBARS, which indicated the extent of oxidative stress, was minimum (10.1 nM g(-1) f w) at Al-Ghalab and maximum (28.1 nM g(-1) f w) at Al-Yazeed, being relatively higher in summer than in winter. Healthy trees had a lower level of TBARS than those suffering from dieback. Proline content showed 147-54 A mu g g(-1) in healthy trees and 460-99 A mu g g(-1) f w in affected ones. Variation in the activity of superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and catalase was around 0.7-3.6, 0.01-0.09, 0.02-0.08, and 0.6-3.0 U mg(-1) min(-1), respectively, in healthy trees, whereas 2.3-6.1, 0.04-0.3, 0.04-0.3, and 2-5.8 U mg(-1) min(-1), respectively, in the dieback-affected trees of the different locations. Thus, the oxidative stress and the enzymatic stimulation were higher in damaged than in healthy trees and in summer than in winter season. Water-harvesting efforts at the collection sites showed ameliorative effects. Our observations suggest that J. procera tree can be made more tolerant toward stressful condition, and even the risk of dieback can be avoided or minimized by improving soil-water availability through adequate water-harvesting strategies in the drought-affected areas.

TI Influence of the exclusion distance among trees on gap fraction and
   foliage clumping index of forest plantations
SO TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
AB A hypergeometric model is proposed explicitly instead of two previous stochastic models (the Poisson model and Neyman-A model) to describe the topological relationship of trees and the influence of the exclusion distance on gap fraction and clumping index of forest plantation canopies.
   Gap fraction (GF) and clumping index (CI) play key roles in plant light interception, and therefore they have strong impacts on plant growth and canopy radiative transfer processes. Trees are usually assumed to be randomly distributed in natural forests in many previous studies. However, few studies have shown how trees are distributed in forest plantations and how these distribution patterns affect GF and CI in these forests. In this paper, a simple and general distance factor defined as relative allowable shortest distance between centers of two adjacent crowns divided by the mean diameter of the crowns (RASD) is proposed to describe quantitatively the degree of mutual exclusion among trees in forest plantations of various tree distribution patterns. A hypergeometric model is proposed instead of two previous stochastic tree distribution models (the Poisson model and Neyman-A model) to describe the topological relationship of trees and the influences of the exclusion distance on the GF and CI of the forest plantation canopies. The results show that: (1) the hypergeometric model is more suitable than the Poisson model and Neyman-A model for describing the topological relationship of trees in forest plantations; (2) the exclusion distance has strong impacts on GF and CI: there are significant differences between the results of the hypergeometric model and the Poisson model. Larger RASD causes lower GF and larger CI. The simulations are verified by field measurements in four forest plantation stands. Similarly, impacts of RASD on GF and CI are also found for other two crown shapes (prolate and oblate ellipsoids).

TI Influence of climatic factors on tree growth in riparian forests in the
   humid and dry savannas of the Volta basin, Ghana
SO TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
AB The paper demonstrates the prospects and applications of dendrochronology for understanding climate change effects on riparian forests in the savanna landscape.
   Riparian trees in savannas have a potential for dendro-climatic studies, but have been neglected hitherto. We examined ring-width series of Afzelia africana (evergreen) and Anogeissus leiocarpus (deciduous) to study the influence of climatic factors on the growth of riparian trees in the humid (HS) and dry (DS) savanna zones of the Volta basin in Ghana. A total of 31 stem discs belonging to A. africana and A. leiocarpus were selected from HS and DS to establish species-specific local chronologies of tree growth. Each individual of A. africana and A. leiocarpus from the two savanna sites showed distinct growth rings. Cross-dating of individual tree-ring patterns was successful using standard dendrochronological techniques. The mean annual growth rates of A. africana in the HS (1.38 +/- 0.09) and DS (1.34 +/- 0.08) were not statistically different. Furthermore, mean annual growth rate of A. leiocarpus in the DS (3.75 +/- 0.27) was higher than in the HS (2.83 +/- 0.16) suggesting that species in drier environment can have higher growth rates when sufficient soil moisture is available. The growth rates of both species at the same sites were different, which might indicate different water use strategies. High correlations of individual tree-ring series of A. africana and A. leiocarpus trees at HS and DS suggest a strong climatic forcing controlled by the seasonal movement of the inter-tropical convergence zone. The annual growth of A. africana and A. leiocarpus at both the HS and DS was significantly correlated with local temperature and precipitation. The negative correlations of the growth of the two tree species to global sea surface temperatures were however, indications that the growth of riparian forests can be impacted during El Nio-Southern Oscillation years. The result of our study shows that riparian trees in the humid and dry savanna zones of West Africa can be successfully used for dendrochronological studies.

TI Climate control on ring width and intra-annual density fluctuations in
   Pinus kesiya growing in a sub-tropical forest of Manipur, Northeast
   India
SO TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
AB Growth ring study of Pinus kesiya (khasi pine) growing in sub-tropical forest in Manipur, northeast India was performed to understand climate signatures in ring widths and intra-annual density fluctuations.
   The growth rings in khasi pine (Pinus kesiya Royle ex Gordon) growing in sub-tropical Reserve Forest in Imphal, Manipur, northeast India were analysed to understand environmental signals present in ring-width series and intra-annual density fluctuations (IADFs). For this the growth ring sequences in increment core samples collected from 28 trees were precisely dated and a ring-width chronology spanning AD 1958-2014 developed. The correlation analyses between ring-width chronology and weather data of Imphal revealed that a cool April-May-June favour tree growth. The wood anatomical features of growth rings revealed the occurrence of IADFs in early- and latewoods. The IADFs in earlywood were found to be associated with reduced precipitation in months from April to July. However, the wetter conditions in late growing season, especially August/September triggered the formation of IADFs in latewood. Our findings endorse that the IADF chronologies of khasi pine could emerge as an important proxy of summer monsoon rainfall in long-term perspective in data scarce region of northeast India.

TI Canopy structure and light interception partitioning among shoots
   estimated from virtual trees: comparison between apple cultivars grown
   on different interstocks on the Chinese Loess Plateau
SO TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
AB Dwarf interstock produced smaller tree size and a more uniform leaf area spatial distribution of vegetative short shoot. These improved light interception and increased light partitioning to fruiting shoot.
   The agronomic efficiency of dwarf interstocks is controversial in China, where almost 90 % of apple orchards, including high-density orchards, currently use vigorous rootstock. We quantified the influence of dwarf interstock on canopy structure and light interception in two apple cultivars commonly grown on the Chinese Loess Plateau. 'Fuji' and 'Gala' apple trees were grafted onto two rootstock/interstock combinations: M. micromalus/M. domestica cv. 'Qinguan', a vigorous interstock and M. micromalus/M26, a dwarf interstock. Nineteen trees, grown with the spindle training system, were digitized and allometric relationships were determined for all shoot types before harvests in 2011 and 2012. Virtual three-dimensional canopies were reconstructed and light interception was evaluated. The spatial distribution of leaf area density of vegetative short shoot was more uniform on dwarf interstock compared to the vigorous interstock. These improvements led to higher light interception efficiency in dwarf interstock trees. There were fewer poorly illuminated within-tree zones and shoots on dwarf interstock than on vigorous interstock. The dwarf interstock trees showed a 25 % silhouette to total leaf area (STAR) increase for the whole tree and 21 and 17 % STAR increases for fruiting shoots and vegetative short shoots, respectively. 'Fuji' foliage was more clumped than 'Gala', leading to lower light interception. The results indicate that dwarf interstocks can effectively improve light interception efficiency.

TI Tree diameter growth after root trenching in a mature mixed stand of
   Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst) and European beech (Fagus
   sylvatica [L.])
SO TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
AB Root trenching of Norway spruce and European beech caused no long-term decrease of stem growth and only temporal growth reductions in European beech.
   Root volume reduction is a common occurrence in silvicultural, urban, and scientific environments, often the direct result of trenching applications. Although this interference is widespread near forest roads and in rural and urban areas, trees' growth reactions to these limitations have rarely been analysed. Here, we compare the growth of 81 mature Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica [L.]) trees, trenched for an experiment down to 1 m depth in a Luvisol soil (Parabraunerde) in 2010, and compared with 69 untrenched trees. The trenching was conducted prior to a long-term precipitation-exclusion treatment in a temperate mixed forest in Southern Germany. Stem and crown sizes, tree positions, distance to the trench, and annual stem growth of the 150 trees were measured from 2006 through 2013. Statistical analysis revealed that (1) stem growth reduction does not correlate with the loss of rooting area by trenching, (2) trenching does not significantly decrease the stem growth in the long-term post-trenching application, and (3) European beech showed a greater reaction in the first years after trenching as indicated by a greater decrease in stem growth. The relationship between stem growth reduction and the loss of rooting area arises during the first year post-trenching, but diminishes by the third year. The trenching effect on stem growth was strongest in trees at the plot edge and diminished towards the centre of the plots, where the actual study trees of the precipitation-exclusion experiment were located. The relevance of trenching for growth reduction is discussed, including potential underlying mechanisms and conclusions about experimental interferences.

TI Root connections affect radial growth of balsam poplar trees
SO TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
AB Connected root systems reduced the negative impact of August temperatures and insect outbreak on growth.
   Root connections between trees can be an ecological advantage of clonal plant species in environments with unevenly distributed resources. We investigated the effects of root connectivity in stands of balsam poplar in Quebec (Canada). We evaluated differences in growth response between groups of trees with and without root connections through climate-growth analyses, comparison of the growth dynamics, and analysis of growth response to a severe forest tent caterpillar (FTC) outbreak. Current May temperature had a positive influence on radial growth of both connected and non-connected trees. Growth of non-connected trees was negatively affected by August temperatures (r = -0.3) while connected trees did not reveal a significant relationship for that month. A mixed effect ANOVA showed a significant difference (F (1, 25) = 5.59, p = 0.02) in growth responses to FTC outbreak between connected and non-connected trees. Connected trees grew on average 16 % better than unconnected trees during the outbreak, with bootstrapped 95 % confidence range from 2.28 to 31.36 %. The study suggests a sharing of resources through root connections, affecting radial growth of connected balsam poplar trees under both average and extreme environmental conditions.

TI Increased sensitivity of Dahurian larch radial growth to summer
   temperature with the rapid warming in Northeast China
SO TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
AB Temperature increase would benefit tree radial growth in the high latitude permafrost zone due to the increment of the thaw depth of permafrost.
   Tree rings from temperature-limited regions are highly sensitive to temperature variations. Seven Dahurian larch (Larix gmelinii Rupr.) tree-ring width chronologies sampled at the permafrost zone in western Great Xing'an Mountain, Northeast China, were developed to investigate regional larch growth. A regional larch growth record was produced using the first principal component (PC1) of a principal components analysis. PC1 accounted for 65.6 % of the total variance. Regional larch growth was mainly limited by summer temperatures in this region. The temporal variations in the linear trend of average summer temperature were calculated at 30-year intervals. A significant increase trend (P < 0.05) was found in average summer temperature after the 1971-2000 period, indicating that temperature started to increase rapidly after the 1971-2000 period; there was no obvious trend before that period. Moreover, the relationship between tree radial growth and temperature intensified since the 1969-1998 period. Thaw depth also started to show significant influences on the tree radial growth after the 1969-1998 period where rapid warming accelerated the thaw of permafrost and benefited tree radial growth. Tree radial growth was more sensitive to temperature after the rapid warming because of changes in the moisture availability caused by the permafrost thaw. From these results, it appears that an increase in temperature would benefit tree radial growth in the high latitude permafrost zone by increasing the thaw depth of permafrost.

TI Eddy covariance analysis of the implications of drought on the carbon
   fluxes of Moso bamboo forest in southeastern China
SO TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
AB Drought decreased the optimal temperature for photosynthesis and significantly reduced carbon fixation of Moso bamboo forest. VPD is a superior indicator for simulating the response of GPP to drought.
   The severity and frequency of drought in the subtropics and tropical marginal convective zones are increasing and consequently greater attention is being given to the effects of drought on the carbon balance of forest ecosystems. Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis (CarriSre) J.Houz.) is an important economic forest type in China that is vulnerable to drought. Using an eddy covariance technique and model simulation, this study analyzed the responses of the carbon fluxes of Moso bamboo to environmental factors during a drought. It was found that temperature had a restricting effect on photosynthesis, and that the optimal temperature for photosynthesis was left-shifted, indicating that drought decreased the optimal temperature for photosynthesis and changed the response of gross primary productivity (GPP) to temperature. In comparison with other environmental factors, the vapor pressure deficit (VPD) was established as a much better indicator for simulating the response of GPP to drought. By including the VPD limitation of GPP in the eddy covariance light use efficiency model, it was found that the model could explain the response of GPP to drought well, reducing the uncertainty in GPP (e.g., the overestimation of GPP under drought-stress conditions). A dynamic linear regression showed drought decreased carbon fixation by roughly 12.7 % of GPP and 44.8 % of the net ecosystem CO2 exchange, but it had no obvious influence on ecosystem respiration.

TI Xylem, phloem, and transpiration flows in developing sweet cherry fruit
SO TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
AB Flow in the phloem increased in developing sweet cherry, whereas xylem flow continuously decreased resulting in a fruit water potential that was independent from the tree at fruit maturity.
   Rain cracking of sweet cherry fruit is associated with water uptake through the skin, but probably also through the vasculature of the pedicel. The aim of this study was to quantify the xylem, phloem, and transpiration contributions to the overall water balance of developing sweet cherry fruit. Using linear variable displacement transducers, changes in fruit diameter were monitored in untreated control fruit, fruit whose pedicels had been steam-girdled, and fruit whose pedicels had been cut through (these fruits were detached, but remained in situ in the canopy). Fruit volume changes with time were inferred from the measured diameter changes. Pedicel xylem and phloem sap-flow rates, and fruit transpiration rates, were inferred from fruit volume changes. Daily phloem flows were low during stage II (phase of pit development), but markedly increased in stage III (phase of cell enlargement in flesh). Xylem flows exceeded phloem flows in stage II, but decreased continuously in stage III to nearly zero at harvest. Transpiration flow essentially mirrored xylem flow in stage II, but exceeded xylem flow in stage III. Transpiration flow was closely related to the water vapour pressure deficit. Phloem flow was linearly related to the increase in fruit dry mass per-unit time. The data reveal a decrease in xylem sap flow throughout stage III resulting in a water-potential isolation of the mature fruit from the tree. Such isolation would prevent uncontrolled osmotic uptake of xylem water by the sugary flesh and a putative backflow in the xylem from fruit to tree.

TI Structural cell contribution to resistance of trees to uprooting
SO TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
AB Structural cells, as a form of suspended pavement, increases the resistance of urban trees to uprooting failure by confining the roots from growing above ground surface.
   Trees planted in urban environment may be prone to uprooting due to poor root development and lack of anchorage in the soil. The stability of the tree can be improved by implementing suspended pavement system to encourage growth of tree root below ground surface. A type of suspended pavement has been developed and used in this study, subsequently referred to as structural cell (SC). Numerical analyses were carried out to investigate the contribution of the SC on the stability of Samanea saman, a common urban tree in Singapore with a shallow root system. A simplified tree-root-soil model was adopted for a parametric study by varying root length at both sides of the tree from 1 to 3 m with an interval of 0.5 m. The SC was added to the model as a confinement on top of the shallow roots to give additional resistance against uprooting. Results show that the SC implementation increased the load resistance to uprooting by reducing the strain developed in root plate base and the underlying soil. However, the tensile and compressive stress on the top fibre of root plate at the windward and leeward sides of tree trunk increased due to the presence of SC. Overall, the presence of SC increases the tree resistance to wind load by 2.5-3.3 times the resistance of the tree without SC.

TI Different responses of non-structural carbohydrates in above-ground
   tissues/organs and root to extreme drought and re-watering in Chinese
   fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) saplings
SO TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
AB The total NSC concentration in the roots declined more significantly than in the above-ground tissues/organs under drought treatment, and the level did not return to that of the control after re-watering.
   Non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) reflect the relative balance between C-gain (photosynthesis) and C-loss (respiration) and play a pivotal role in carbon cycling in a forest ecosystem. However, little is known regarding the effects of extreme drought and re-watering on the NSC status in different tissues/organs. This study examined the variation in NSC concentrations in different tissues/organs and the total NSC pool sizes in Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) saplings after drought and re-watering. Results showed that significant differences were observed in the concentrations of total NSC and its components in the different tissues/organs. For example, the NSC concentrations were nine times higher in bark than in stemwood. Moreover, the responses of NSC and its components to extreme drought also varied in different tissues/organs. Drought either significantly increased or maintained the total NSC concentration in the above-ground tissues/organs. By contrast, drought reduced the total NSC concentration in the sapling roots. Furthermore, the results also showed that extreme drought leads to sapling death, which is supported by the result of needle staining and the failure of the total NSC concentration to recover after re-watering. The concentrations of NSC and its components further decreased, and a more pronounced decline was observed in the roots than in the above-ground tissues/organs after re-watering. We speculated that drought can cause failure in carbon translocation between the above- and below-ground tissues/organs and thus cause varied responses of different tissues/organs to extreme drought and re-watering. Overall, these findings suggest the need to investigate the potential differential responses of various tissues/organs to climate change.

TI Genetic variability and phenotypic plasticity of apple morphological
   responses to soil water restriction in relation with leaf functions and
   stem xylem conductivity
SO TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
AB In drought-stressed apple, leaf area decrease and stem growth cessation increase are key determinants of drought avoidance. Both the genotype and its possible phenotypic plasticity contribute to the variability of responses.
   Under soil water restriction, plant growth is impaired by the indirect negative impact on plant carbon balance of stomata closure and hydraulic failure. The relative contributions of these two phenomena have been scarcely explored in trees under different drought-stress intensities, and even less work is published which accounts for genetic variability and phenotypic plasticity. Working on 21 apple genotypes from the same progeny, we assessed the effects of two consecutive periods of soil drought, moderate and severe, on growth and functional patterns of leaf and stem. Leaf area decreased while temporary stem growth cessation increased under drought with strong variations depending on the genotype. These results suggested that both reduction of transpiring leaf area and leaf organogenesis are key determinants for drought avoidance in the apple. Results also confirmed the pivotal role of stomatal conductance (g (s)) in maintaining percent loss of conductivity of the stem xylem (PLC) under values for runaway embolism (ca. 14 % under severe drought). The sorting of genotypes according to their morphological response to drought showed that genotypes with high reduction of growth were characterized by similar g (s) but lower PLC than genotypes with medium and low reduction of growth. This suggests that for a given level of stomatal closure the drought-related reduction of leaf area could also limit the progression of cavitation in stem xylem. As a whole, the variability of morphological responses of apple genotypes to contrasted drought conditions indicated that both genetic variability and phenotypic plasticity are involved in the range of iso-anisohydry documented for this species.

TI The potential of soil seed banks of a eucalypt wetland forest to aid
   restoration
SO WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB Soil seed banks can play an important role in the regeneration of wetland vegetation. However, their potential role in the restoration of degraded wetland forests is less certain. I surveyed the soil seed bank and extant floras of four sites across a eucalypt wetland forest of variable vegetation condition. At each site, the extant vegetation was surveyed within two 5 x 5 m(2) quadrats, each from which five composite soil seed bank samples were collected. Across the four sites, 57 (including 18 exotic) species were identified in the extant vegetation, while from the seed bank samples 6379 seedlings emerged from 80 taxa, 33 of which were exotic species. The soil seed bank was dominated by native and exotic monocots, and contained very few seeds of wetland tree or shrub species. Overall, the similarity between the extant and seed bank floras was very low (similar to 24 %). Soil seed banks are likely to be of limited use in the restoration of degraded wetland forests, because the dominant species in such systems-woody and clonal plants-are typically absent from the soil seed bank. Wetland soil seed banks may contribute to the maintenance and diversity of understorey vegetation, however, they may also act as a source of exotic plant invasions, particularly when a wetland is degraded.

TI Hybrid QoS based routing protocol for inter and intra wireless mesh
   infrastructure communications
SO WIRELESS NETWORKS
AB Quality of service (QoS) in wireless mesh networks is an active area of research, which is driven by the increasing demand for real-time and multimedia applications, such as Voice over IP and Video on Demand. In this paper, we propose a novel QoS based routing protocol for wireless mesh infrastructure, called Hybrid QoS Mesh Routing (HQMR). It is composed of two QoS based routing sub-protocols: a reactive multi-metric routing protocol for intra-infrastructure communications and a proactive multi-tree based routing protocol for communications with external networks. The proposed routing protocol enables forwarding real-time and streaming applications with QoS guarantee in a mesh wireless environment, by assigning a specific routing path for each defined service class. To this end, three different QoS service classes are defined, depending on the applications requirements. We analyze in this paper the simulation results of different scenarios conducted on the network simulator ns-3 to demonstrate the effectiveness of the HQMR protocol and to compare it to other routing protocols while forwarding real-time applications with QoS guarantee.

TI An empirical study on green practices of mobile phone users
SO WIRELESS NETWORKS
AB Given the market's saturation with smartphones and the increased power needs that these have as compared with older feature phones, the users' green practices and behavior is emerging as an important research topic. The environmental aspects and general awareness issues are not addressed in this study; however, the limited battery life of smartphones is a decisive factor that shapes the users' behavior, practices and preferences. As such, the users need to follow green practices and carefully assess the energy related characteristics (speed, screen size, weight, and price) that they value the most in a smartphone, to maximize their experience. Based on our previous work that gathered relevant data from 313 users, we extended the analysis in order to examine the user battery life and charging practices, buying habits, green practices and preferences. To that end, we used quantitative statistics and Fuzzy Decision Tree analysis to propose relevant Fuzzy Decision Rules that can classify the results and profile the users.

TI Distributed object tracking using moving trajectories in wireless sensor
   networks
SO WIRELESS NETWORKS
AB Most recent research on object tracking sensor networks has focused on collecting all data from the sensor network into the sink, which delivers the predicted locations to the corresponding nodes in order to accurately predict object movement. The communication cost of this centralized scenario is higher than that of a distributed method. Centralized data collection affects the freshness of the data and increases latency in movement trajectory prediction. In addition, due to the large amount of packets being sent and received, sensor node energy is quickly exhausted. Although this data collection method might result in higher accuracy for prediction, the sensor network lifetime is not reduced. In this paper, a distributed object tracking method is proposed using the network structure of convex polygons, called faces. The nodes in the faces cooperate to find the trajectories of an object and then these trajectories are used to predict the objects' movement. The proposed method, based on trajectory tree construction, can reduce both the storage space of collected trajectories and the time spent on trajectory prediction analysis. Simulations show that the proposed method can reduce the energy consumption of the nodes and make prediction of nodes moving direction accurately than the existing approaches.

TI A time efficient aggregation convergecast scheduling algorithm for
   wireless sensor networks
SO WIRELESS NETWORKS
AB We investigated the aggregation convergecast scheduling problem in wireless sensor networks. In order to reduce the time needed for data collection through aggregation convergecast, we propose a scheduling algorithm based on an aggregation tree which enables a small delay lower bound and a time slot allocation method which uses the time slots efficiently. To achieve a small delay lower bound, we take the sum of the receiver's depth and child number as the cost of the transmission links and then construct an aggregation tree gradually by adding to it a link with the minimum cost iteration by iteration. To use the time slots efficiently, we use a neighbor degree ranking algorithm together with a supplementary scheduling algorithm to allocate time slot for the sensor nodes. Experiments show that the proposed scheduling algorithm outperforms other work in most cases by reducing the number of time slots needed for data collection by more than 10 %, which indicates the feasibility of our approach for data collection in wireless sensor networks.

TI Lobectomy is a more Cost-Effective Option than Total Thyroidectomy for 1
   to 4 cm Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma that do not Possess Clinically
   Recognizable High-Risk Features
SO ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
AB Although lobectomy is a viable alternative to total thyroidectomy (TT) in low-risk 1 to 4 cm papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), lobectomy is associated with higher locoregional recurrence risk and need for completion TT upon discovery of a previously unrecognized histologic high-risk feature (HRF). The present study evaluated long-term cost-effectiveness between lobectomy and TT.
   Our base case was a hypothetical female cohort aged 40 years with a low-risk 2.5 cm PTC. A Markov decision tree model was constructed to compare cost-effectiveness between lobectomy and TT after 25 years. Patients with an unrecognized HRF (including aggressive histology, microscopic extrathyroidal extension, lymphovascular invasion, positive resection margin, nodal metastasis > 5 mm, and multifocality) underwent completion TT after lobectomy. Outcome probabilities, utilities, and costs were estimated from the literature. The threshold for cost-effectiveness was set at US$50,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Sensitivity and threshold analyses were used to examine model uncertainty.
   After 25 years, each patient who underwent lobectomy instead of TT cost an extra US$772.08 but gained an additional 0.300 QALY. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was US$2577.65/QALY. In the sensitivity analysis, the lobectomy arm began to become cost-effective only after 3 years. Despite varying the reported prevalence of clinically unrecognized HRFs, complication from surgical procedures, annualized recurrence rates, unit cost of surgical procedure or complication, and utility score, lobectomy remained more cost-effective than TT.
   Despite the higher locoregional recurrence risk and having almost half of the patients undergoing completion TT after lobectomy upon discovery of a previously unrecognized HRF, initial lobectomy was a more cost-effective long-term option than initial TT for 1 to 4 cm PTCs without clinically recognized HRFs.

TI High-Level Culturability of Epiphytic Bacteria and Frequency of
   Biosurfactant Producers on Leaves
SO APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB To better characterize the bacterial community members capable of biosurfactant production on leaves, we distinguished culturable biosurfactant-producing bacteria from nonproducers and used community sequencing to compare the composition of these distinct cultured populations with that from DNA directly recovered from leaves. Communities on spinach, romaine, and head lettuce leaves were compared with communities from adjacent samples of soil and irrigation source water. Soil communities were poorly described by culturing, with recovery of cultured representatives from only 21% of the prevalent operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (>0.2% reads) identified. The dominant biosurfactant producers cultured from soil included bacilli and pseudomonads. In contrast, the cultured communities from leaves are highly representative of the culture-independent communities, with over 85% of the prevalent OTUs recovered. The dominant taxa of surfactant producers from leaves were pseudomonads as well as members of the infrequently studied genus Chryseobacterium. The proportions of bacteria cultured from head lettuce and romaine leaves that produce biosurfactants were directly correlated with the culture-independent proportion of pseudomonads in a given sample, whereas spinach harbored a wider diversity of biosurfactant producers. A subset of the culturable bacteria in irrigation water also became enriched on romaine leaves that were irrigated overhead. Although our study was designed to identify surfactant producers on plants, we also provide evidence that most bacteria in some habitats, such as agronomic plant surfaces, are culturable, and these communities can be readily investigated and described by more classical culturing methods.

SO ARCHIVES OF VIROLOGY
AB Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) has been reported in many countries, including Hong Kong, the United States, South Korea, China and Thailand. In January 2016, clinical diarrhea similar to that of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) with a lower mortality rate was reported on a swine farm in Lao PDR. Intestine samples were collected from 3-day-old pigs with clinical diarrhea and assayed for the presence of swine enteric coronaviruses. The PCR results were positive for PDCoV but negative for PEDV and TGEV. A phylogenetic tree demonstrated that PDCoV from Lao PDR was grouped separately from PDCoV isolates from China and the USA, but was more closely related to the Chinese isolates than to the US isolates. The full-length genome sequence of the novel PDCoV isolate P1_16_BTL_0116 was determined.

TI Neotropical rainforest restoration: comparing passive, plantation and
   nucleation approaches
SO BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB Neotropical rainforests are global biodiversity hotspots and are challenging to restore. A core part of this challenge is the very long recovery trajectory of the system: recovery of structure can take 20-190 years, species composition 60-500 years, and reestablishment of rare/endemic species thousands of years. Passive recovery may be fraught with instances of arrested succession, disclimax or emergence of novel ecosystems. In these cases, active restoration methods are essential to speed recovery and set a desired restoration trajectory. Tree plantation is the most common active approach to reestablish a high density of native tree species and facilitate understory regeneration. While this approach may speed the successional trajectory, it may not achieve, and possibly inhibit, a long-term restoration trajectory towards the high species diversity characteristic of these forests. A range of nucleation techniques (e.g., tree island planting) are important restoration options: although they may not speed recovery of structure as quickly as plantations, their emphasis on natural regeneration processes may enable greater and more natural patterns of diversity to develop. While more work needs to be done to compare forest restoration techniques in different environmental contexts, it appears that nucleation and, at times, passive restoration may best preserve the diverse legacy of these forested systems (both with lower costs). An integrated approach using both plantation productivity but also the natural functions associated with nucleation may develop composition and diversity trajectory desired in Neotropical conservation efforts.

TI Change in the bryophyte diversity and species composition of Central
   European temperate broad-leaved forests since the late nineteenth
   century
SO BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB The diversity and species composition of the bryophyte flora colonizing the forest floor, live trees and deadwood in semi-natural broad-leaved forests of northern Germany was compared between a recent survey in 2013 and historical records from around 1900. The survey was based on the comparison of presence/absence data and their interpretation with help of ecological indicator values. Total species richness has declined in bryophytes growing on the forest floor but not in the other guilds, whereas a dramatic species turnover was found for all three guilds. This turnover was apparently primarily driven by the increased atmospheric load of reactive nitrogen from anthropogenic emissions. Sensitive species were replaced by more eutrophication-tolerant bryophytes; liverworts are overrepresented among the sensitive and thus declining species. Promotion of the competitive strength of vascular plants due to increased nitrogen levels is the likely cause of the reduction of bryophyte species richness on the forest floor. Former acidification by high atmospheric sulfur dioxide loads has left an imprint in the bryophyte vegetation by having favored acidophytic species and discriminating against basiphytic species. An increase in the mean indicator value for temperature suggests a beginning effect of climate warming on the bryophyte vegetation. Change in forest structure had an apparently smaller imprint on the bryophyte diversity of the studied semi-natural forests than atmospheric chemistry and climate. In this respect, bryophytes differ from the ecologically similar lichens, where published studies from the same region showed a dramatic decline of species richness and a stronger susceptibility to forest management.

TI Phylogenetic diversity and its conservation in the presence of
   phylogenetic uncertainty: a case study of cladoceran communities in
   urban waterbodies
SO BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB The need to protect and preserve biodiversity is a pressing issue and requires that conservation projects be based on solid foundations. Knowledge of species evolutionary history can serve as a tool to help guide conservation projects on the basis of evolutionary heritage. We used communities of Cladocera (Crustacea, Branchiopoda) in urban waterbodies to identify which sites should be prioritized for phylogenetic diversity conservation. Phylogenetic trees were inferred using DNA sequences from two mitochondrial genes. Furthermore, we also evaluated the consequences of phylogenetic uncertainty for identifying sites for conservation priority. Using results from Bayesian analyses, we considered the effect of uncertainty in the phylogenetic tree on phylogenetic diversity (PD) estimation. When phylogenetic uncertainty was taken into account, the conservation value of individual sites became uncertain and several potential comparisons between sites could not be supported. Consequently prioritization of one site over the other could not be defended in biodiversity conservation projects. Our study highlights the fact that accounting for phylogenetic uncertainty can alter the relative conservation priority of sites, as assessed by their phylogenetic diversity. Therefore, variability in the phylogenetic estimates should be consistently considered and integrated into estimates of phylogenetic diversity and conservation decisions to avoid making suboptimal choices.

TI De novo assembly and transcriptome characterization of spruce dwarf
   mistletoe Arceuthobium sichuanense uncovers gene expression profiling
   associated with plant development
SO BMC GENOMICS
AB Background: The parasitic flowering plant dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium spp., Viscaceae) is one of the most destructive forest pests, posing a major threat to numerous conifer species worldwide. Arceuthobium sichuanense (spruce dwarf mistletoe, SDM) infects Qinghai spruce (Picea crassifolia) and causes severe damage to spruce forests in Northwest China. SDM is a Chinese native parasitic plant and acquires carbohydrates and mineral nutrition from its hosts. However, underlying molecular basis of the physiological development is largely unknown. Investigations of these physiological traits have been hampered by the lack of genomic resources for this species.
   Results: In this study, to investigate the transcriptomic processes underlying physiological traits and development in SDM, we used RNA from four major tissues (i.e., shoots, flowers, fruits, and seeds) for de novo assembly and to annotate the transcriptome of this species. We uncovered the annotated transcriptome and performed whole genome expression profiling to uncover transcriptional dynamics during physiological development, and we identified key gene categories involved in the process of sexual development. The assembled SDM transcriptome reported in this work contains 331,347 assembled transcripts; 226,687 unigenes were functionally annotated by Gene Ontology analysis. RNA-Seq analysis using this reference transcriptome identified 22,641 differentially expressed genes from shoots, flowers, fruits, and seeds. These genes are enriched in processes including organic substance metabolism, cellular metabolism, biosynthesis, and cellular component. In addition, genes related to transport, transcription, hormone biosynthesis and signaling, carbohydrate metabolism, and photosynthesis were differentially expressed between tissues.
   Conclusion: This work reveals tissue-specific gene expression patterns and pathways of SDM and implied to a difference between photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic tissues in plants. The data can potentially be used for future investigations on endophytic parasitism and SDM-spruce interaction, and it dramatically increases the available genomic resources for Arceuthobium and dwarf mistletoe communities. This preliminary study of the Arceuthobium transcriptome provides excellent opportunities for characterizing plant parasitic genes with unknown functions.

TI Supercooling points of diapausing forest tent caterpillar (Lepidoptera:
   Lasiocampidae) eggs
SO CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST
AB Forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria Hubner; Lepidoptera: Lasiocampidae) is a widely distributed defoliator that undergoes intermittent outbreaks. It overwinters as pharate larvae within egg bands, is univoltine, and experiences low winter temperatures in its northern range. Little is known about how low temperatures affect winter survival and cold tolerances, their cold tolerance strategy, or how cold tolerances may vary over time and among populations. We evaluated supercooling points (SCPs) from four populations of M. disstria eggs collected along a 552 km latitudinal gradient from southern Wisconsin to northern Minnesota, United States of America. To test for potential effects of winter environment, we also administered three overwintering regimes (Madison, Wisconsin; Cloquet, Minnesota; Ely, Minnesota). Supercooling points were recorded in November, February, and March of 2011-2012. Supercooling points varied with maternal source (egg band), time of winter season, population source, and overwintering treatment. Means ranged from -26.8 degrees C (+/- 0.5 degrees C) to -40.3 degrees C (+/- 0.3 degrees C), accordingly. In a separate laboratory experiment, 89% of pharate larvae held at -20 degrees C (18.3 degrees C above coolest mean SCP) survived, but none held at -45 degrees C (6.7 degrees C below lowest mean SCP) survived. This relatively high degree of cold tolerance in its overwintering stage, due to freeze avoidance, may partially explain survival patterns and limits of overwintering M. disstria in northern populations.

TI Complex ecological relationships among an assemblage of indigenous
   hymenopteran parasitoids, the exotic European woodwasp (Sirex noctilio;
   Hymenoptera: Siricidae), and a native congener
SO CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST
AB We collected naturally infested Pinus resinosa Aiton (Pinaceae) and P. sylvestris Linnaeus to investigate phenological patterns and quantify parasitism by a suite of native hymenopteran parasitoids on two woodwasps (Hymenoptera: Siricidae): the invading non-native European woodwasp, Sirex noctilio Fabricius, and a co-colonising native, S. nigricornis Fabricius. We sampled a total of 76 trees from two field sites in 2010 and seven sites in 2011. In raw abundance, S. noctilio outnumbered S. nigricornis by 2:1 in 2010 and by 7.5:1 in 2011. We collected the egg/early instar parasitoid, Ibalia leucospoides ensiger Norton (Hymenoptera: Ibaliidae); four species of Rhyssinae (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) late larval parasitoids; and Pseudorhyssa nigricornis (Ratzeburg) (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae), a cleptoparasitoid of rhyssines. Variation in siricid and parasitoid species assemblage and abundance was explained primarily by site, with tree-level factors playing a secondary role. Parasitism was significantly lower in P. sylvestris (13.6%+/- 4.1 SE), a naturalised pine from Europe, than in the native P. resinosa (28.5%+/- 5.0). Total parasitism was 27.6%+/- 5.0 in 2010 and 20.9%+/- 4.7 in 2011. This study represents the most robust analysis of the diverse woodwasp and parasitoid assemblage infesting pines in North America.

TI Saproxylic beetle (Coleoptera) diversity in subalpine whitebark pine and
   lodgepole pine (Pinaceae) trees killed by mountain pine beetles
   (Coleoptera: Curculionidae)
SO CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST
AB Whitebark pine, Pinus albicaulis Engelmann (Pinaceae), a foundational species of North American subalpine ecosystems, is endangered across its range and continued decline is inevitable. Little is known about the invertebrate fauna associated with this species which, if specific to whitebark pine, may also be threatened or endangered. We compared the composition of saproxylic beetle assemblages associated with whitebark pine and co-occurring lodgepole pine, Pinus contorta latifolia (Engelmann) Critchfield (Pinaceae), recently killed by mountain pine beetle (MPB), Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), in subalpine forests in Alberta, Canada. Redundancy and rarefaction analyses revealed that beetle assemblage composition was influenced by snag class (i.e., time since death) but differed little among the two pine species within snag classes. However, a subset of the assemblage known to be associated with the MPB differed significantly in composition between the two pines. No common species were exclusively associated with whitebark pines; however, seven species were rarely collected only on whitebark pine. With the possible exception of these rare species, felling and burning infested whitebark pines to control the MPB will not likely endanger saproxylic beetles associated with this tree.

TI Records of unsuccessful attack by Anoplophora glabripennis (Coleoptera:
   Cerambycidae) on broadleaf trees of questionable suitability in Canada
SO CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST
AB Discovery of the non-native Anoplophora glabripennis Motschulsky (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) in Ontario, Canada, in 2003 led to the implementation of an eradication programme. The plan consisted of removing all infested trees and all trees belonging to a genus considered suitable for complete development of this wood-borer that were found within 400 m of an infested tree; however, many of the trees within that 400 m belonged to genera for which suitability for development of A. glabripennis was questionable or unknown. We visually inspected over 3000 such trees annually for the three years following removal of infested trees. All but one tree were unattacked: an ash (Fraxinus excelsior Linnaeus (Oleaceae)) tree had signs of oviposition and early-instar development, but not of adult emergence. Before that survey, we had found only one other species with questionable suitability, a little leaf linden (Tilia cordata Miller (Malvaceae)) that had many signs of oviposition, but no evidence of full development, suggesting resistance to A. glabripennis. Both of these trees were within 200 m of the most heavily infested maple (Acer platanoides Linnaeus (Sapindaceae)) tree found in that infestation, suggesting that colonisation of trees with questionable or unknown suitability might occur mostly where population pressure is high.

SO CLADISTICS
AB The origins and meanings of cladogram are reviewed. Traditionally, cladogram has been defined as a graphical representation of an empirical hypothesis of relationships among taxa, based on evidence from synapomorphies alone. Disturbingly, numerous recent authors treat cladogram as synonymous with dendrogram and do not appreciate the particular methodological connotations of the former term. This is lamented.

TI Testing an ansatz for the leading secular loop corrections from quantum

SO CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
AB It is widely believed that the leading secular loop corrections from quantum gravity can be subsumed into a coordinate redefinition. Hence the apparent infrared logarithm corrections to any quantity would be just the result of taking the expectation value of the tree order quantity at the transformed coordinates in the graviton vacuum. We term this the transformation ansatz and we compare its predictions against explicit one loop computations in Maxwell + Einstein and Dirac + Einstein on de Sitter background. In each case the ansatz fails.

TI The hidden symbols of the female anatomy in Michelangelo Buonarroti's
   ceiling in the Sistine Chapel
SO CLINICAL ANATOMY
AB A number of published articles have suggested that each element of Renaissance art contains an inner meaning. Some of these elements include the choice of theme and protagonists, faces selected for the characters, colors used, species of flowers and trees chosen, animals depicted, positions of the elements, posture of the characters and their gestures, juxtapositions in the scenes, and even the very scenario or landscape. All of these elements are thought to have hidden meanings. In this context, this manuscript presents a new hypothesis suggesting that Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475-1564) may have concealed symbols associated with female anatomy in the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel (painted 1508-1512) in Rome. Thus, this paper is useful to better understand the history of anatomy and corroborates recent descriptions that have suggested the possible existence of anatomic figures concealed in many of Michelangelo's works.

TI Toward quantification of the impact of 21st-century deforestation on the
   extinction risk of terrestrial vertebrates
SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB Conservation actions need to be prioritized, often taking into account species' extinction risk. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List provides an accepted, objective framework for the assessment of extinction risk. Assessments based on data collected in the field are the best option, but the field data to base these on are often limited. Information collected through remote sensing can be used in place of field data to inform assessments. Forests are perhaps the best-studied land-cover type for use of remote-sensing data. Using an open-access 30-m resolution map of tree cover and its change between 2000 and 2012, we assessed the extent of forest cover and loss within the distributions of 11,186 forest-dependent amphibians, birds, and mammals worldwide. For 16 species, forest loss resulted in an elevated extinction risk under red-list criterion A, owing to inferred rapid population declines. This number increased to 23 when data-deficient species (i.e., those with insufficient information for evaluation) were included. Under red-list criterion B2, 484 species (855 when data-deficient species were included) were considered at elevated extinction risk, owing to restricted areas of occupancy resulting from little forest cover remaining within their ranges. The proportion of species of conservation concern would increase by 32.8% for amphibians, 15.1% for birds, and 24.7% for mammals if our suggested uplistings are accepted. Central America, the Northern Andes, Madagascar, the Eastern Arc forests in Africa, and the islands of Southeast Asia are hotspots for these species. Our results illustrate the utility of satellite imagery for global extinction-risk assessment and measurement of progress toward international environmental agreement targets.
   Hacia la Cuantificacion del Impacto de la Deforestacion del Siglo XXI sobre el Riesgo de Extincion de los Vertebrados Terrestres Las acciones de conservacion necesitan ser priorizadas, considerando con frecuencia el riesgo de extincion de las especies. La Lista Roja de la Union Internacional para la Conservacion de la Naturaleza (UICN) proporciona un marco de trabajo objetivo y aceptado para la valoracion del riesgo de extincion. Las valoraciones basadas en los datos colectados en el campo son la mejor opcion, pero los datos de campo sobre los cuales basar las valoraciones con frecuencia son limitados. Los datos colectados por medio de la teledeteccion pueden usarse en lugar de los datos de campo para informar a las valoraciones. Los bosques tal vez sean el tipo de cubierta de suelo mejor estudiado para el uso de datos de teledeteccion. Con un mapa de acceso abierto y resolucion de 30-m de la cobertura de arboles y su cambio entre 2000 y 2012, valoramos la extension de la cobertura de bosque y la perdida dentro de las distribuciones de 11, 186 especies de anfibios, aves y mamiferos dependientes del bosque a nivel mundial. Para 16 especies, la perdida del bosque resulto en un riesgo de extincion elevado, bajo el criterio A de la lista roja, debido a las declinaciones rapidas de poblacion inferidas. Este numero incremento a 23 cuando las especies con deficiencia de datos (es decir, aquellas con informacion insuficiente para su evaluacion) fueron incluidas. Bajo el criterio B2 de la lista roja, 484 especies (855 cuando se incluyeron las especies con deficiencia de datos) se consideraron con riesgo alto de extincion, debido a las areas restringidas de ocupacion como resultado de la pequena cobertura del bosque que permanece dentro de su distribucion. La proporcion de especies de interes para la conservacion incrementaria en 32.8 % para los anfibios, 15.1 % para las aves y 24.7 % para los mamiferos si nuestros cambios de categoria sugeridos son aceptados. America Central, los Andes del norte, Madagascar, los bosques del Arco Oriental de africa y las islas del sureste asiatico son puntos clave para estas especies. Nuestros resultados ilustran la utilidad de las imagenes satelitales para la valoracion global de la extincion de riesgo y para la medicion del progreso hacia los objetivos de los acuerdos ambientales internacionales.

TI Conservation of genetic diversity in slippery elm (Ulmus rubra) in
   Wisconsin despite the devastating impact of Dutch elm disease
SO CONSERVATION GENETICS
AB Forest pest epidemics are responsible for many population declines reported in forest trees. While forest tree populations tend to be genetically diverse, in principle mortality resulting from disease could diminish that genetic diversity and alter the genetic structure of the remnant populations with consequences for the ability of a species to adapt to changing environments. Slippery elm (Ulmus rubra Muhl.) is a long-lived, wind-pollinated forest tree with a native range covering essentially all of eastern North America. Dutch elm disease (DED) caused by an introduced fungal pathogen (Ophiostoma ulmi) devastated North American elm populations, including slippery elm, beginning in the 1930s. Estimates of the numbers of elms lost to DED are unknown but range into the hundreds of millions of trees given their former abundance. In this study, the genotypes of 77 herbarium specimens collected between 1890 and 2004 in Wisconsin, and of 100 slippery elm trees from five wild Wisconsin populations, were characterized using 13 microsatellite loci. Levels of genetic diversity were compared between the herbarium specimens collected pre- and post-DED spread in Wisconsin. In addition, the levels of genetic diversity and degree of genetic differentiation were quantified in the five wild populations. The allelic diversity and expected levels of heterozygosity were similar between the pre- and post-DED herbarium specimens. The five wild populations were only slightly differentiated and no genetic bottleneck was detected for any population. At least in Wisconsin, slippery elm apparently has maintained levels of genetic diversity that could facilitate adaptation to future climatic and environmental changes.

TI Forest cover mediates genetic connectivity of northwestern cougars
SO CONSERVATION GENETICS
AB Population structure, connectivity, and dispersal success of individuals can be challenging to demonstrate for solitary carnivores with low population densities. Though the cougar (Puma concolor) is widely distributed throughout North America and is capable of dispersing long distances, populations can be geographically structured and genetic isolation has been documented in some small populations. We described genetic structure and explored the relationship between landscape resistance and genetic variation in cougars in Washington and southern British Columbia using allele frequencies of 17 microsatellite loci for felids. We evaluated population structure of cougars using the Geneland clustering algorithm and spatial principal components analysis. We then used Circuitscape to estimate the landscape resistance between pairs of individuals based on rescaled GIS layers for forest canopy cover, elevation, human population density and highways. We quantified the effect of landscape resistance on genetic distance using multiple regression on distance matrices and boosted regression tree analysis. Cluster analysis identified four populations in the study area. Multiple regression on distance matrices and boosted regression tree models indicated that only forest canopy cover and geographic distance between individuals had an effect on genetic distance. The boundaries between genetic clusters largely corresponded with breaks in forest cover, showing agreement between population structure and genetic gradient analyses. Our data indicate that forest cover promotes gene flow for cougars in the Pacific Northwest, which provides insight managers can use to preserve or enhance genetic connectivity.

TI Influence of institutional access and social capital on adaptation
   decision: Empirical evidence from hazard-prone rural households in
   Bangladesh
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB An understanding of the factors that shape resource-poor households' heterogeneity in adopting adaptation strategies is crucial in developing adaptation policies. This research examines the determinants of household adaptation choices and the barriers to adaptation. It also focuses on the influence of institutional access and social capital on adaptation choice as a way forward to support and sustain local adaptation process by using the survey data of 380 hazards-prone vulnerable households in Bangladesh. The results reveal that households are implementing adaptation strategies such as diversifying crops, tree plantation (adopted by large and medium farmers), and homestead gardening and migration (adopted by small and landless farmers). Barriers to adaptation are observed heterogeneously among the farming groups where access to credit and lack of information on appropriate adaptation strategies are among the important barriers to adaptation. The model results indicate that the choice of adaptation strategies is significantly influenced by social capital and access to institutions. To support adaptation locally and to enhance vulnerable households' resilience to better cope with riverbank erosion and other climatic change issues, interventions by the government through planned adaptation, such as access to institutions and credit facilities, and a package of technologies through agro-ecological based research are required.

TI Google Street View as an alternative method to car surveys in
   large-scale vegetation assessments
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB Car surveys (CS) are a common method for assessing the distribution of alien invasive plants. Google Street View (GSV), a free-access web technology where users may experience a virtual travel along roads, has been suggested as a cost-effective alternative to car surveys. We tested if we could replicate the results from a countrywide survey conducted by car in Portugal using GSV as a remote sensing tool, aiming at assessing the distribution of Eucalyptus globulus Labill. wildlings on roadsides adjacent to eucalypt stands. Georeferenced points gathered along CS were used to create road transects visible as lines overlapping the road in GSV environment, allowing surveying the same sampling areas using both methods. This paper presents the results of the comparison between the two methods. Both methods produced similar models of plant abundance, selecting the same explanatory variables, in the same hierarchical order of importance and depicting a similar influence on plant abundance. Even though the GSV model had a lower performance and the GSV survey detected fewer plants, additional variables collected exclusively with GSV improved model performance and provided a new insight into additional factors influencing plant abundance. The survey using GSV required ca. 9 % of the funds and 62 % of the time needed to accomplish the CS. We conclude that GSV may be a cost-effective alternative to CS. We discuss some advantages and limitations of GSV as a survey method. We forecast that GSV may become a widespread tool in road ecology, particularly in large-scale vegetation assessments.

TI Levels of selected trace elements in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.),
   silver birch (Betula pendula L.), and Norway maple (Acer platanoides L.)
   in an urbanized environment
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB The aim of the study was to determine the concentrations of selected trace elements in needles and bark of Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris L.), leaves and bark of silver birch ( Betula pendula L.), and Norway maple ( Acer platanoides L.), as well as in the soil in which the trees grew, depending on their localization and hence the distribution of local pollution sources. The content of trace elements in needles of Scots pine, leaves of silver birch, and Norway maple and in bark of these trees depended on the location, tree species, and analyzed organ. The content of Fe, Mn, and Zn in needles, leaves, and bark of the examined tree species was significantly higher than that of the other elements. The highest average content of Fe and Mn was detected in leaves of Norway maple whereas the highest average content of Zn was found in silver birch leaves. The impact of such locations as the center of Olsztyn or roadside along Road 51 on the content of individual elements tended to be more pronounced than the influence of the other locations. The influence of the sampling sites on the content of trace elements in tree bark was less regular than the analogous effect in needles and leaves. Moreover, the relevant dependences were slightly different for Scots pine than for the other two tree species. The concentrations of heavy metals determined in the soil samples did not exceed the threshold values set in the Regulation of the Minister for the Environment, although the soil along Road 51 and in the center of Olsztyn typically had the highest content of these elements. There were also significant correlations between the content of some trace elements in soil and their accumulation in needles, leaves, and bark of trees.

TI Sap flow characteristics and their response to environmental variables
   in a desert riparian forest along lower Heihe River Basin, Northwest
   China
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB Hysteresis, related to tree sap flow and associated environmental variables, plays a critical ecological role in the comprehensive understanding of forest water use dynamics. Nevertheless, only limited researches related to this unique ecological phenomenon have been conducted to date in desert riparian forests under extreme arid regions. Populus euphratica Oliv sap flow velocity (V-S) was measured during the 2012 growing season using the heat ratio method, at the same time as environmental variables, such as photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and leaf water potential. We found clockwise patterns of hysteresis between V-S and VPD but anticlockwise patterns between V-S and PAR. Pronounced hysteretic V-S lag time, a function of PAR and VPD, was approximately 1.0 similar to 1.5 and -0.5 h, respectively. Hysteresis was primarily caused by the biophysical declining in canopy conductance. Sigmoid response of V-S to synthetic meteorological variables was enhanced by approximately 56 % after hysteresis calibration to sunny days. Consequently, hysteresis can be seen as a protection mechanism for plants to avoid the overlapping of peak V-S and environmental variables. Furthermore, the consistent presence of hysteresis suggested that estimating of plant water use in large temporal and spatial models may require certain provisions to different V-S responses to variables between morning and afternoon and between seasons.

TI Plants' healthiness assessment as part of the environmental monitoring
   of protected mountainous area in the example of Karkonosze (Giant) Mts.
   (SW Poland)
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB The aim of phytopathological monitoring is to check the healthiness of plants and observe the changes that occur in their populations. In the vast majority, these types of observations are conducted in agriculture and forestry. An interesting aspect of phytopathological monitoring is the assessment of the origin of the plant species. The research of fungal communities (including pathogens) in plants may, for example, indicate the relic nature of the plant species. Reduction of the occurrence or disappearance of fungi species associated with its host plant can evidence slow decline of their habitats. This applies mainly to arctic-alpine fungal species. On the other hand, for some plant hosts, colonization of their organs by polyphagous fungi is being recorded. One such example is the downy willow, on which six species of fungi were found in the Karkonosze Mts. In 2014, there were no fungi found on this plant. However, comparing the species composition of fungi associated with downy willow given by Schroeter (1908) to the contemporary one and to the study results of other researchers, a decrease in the number of fungi species is clearly visible. This may be related to the environmental pollution, which took place in the Sudetes in the second half of the twentieth century. For instance, the species of the genus Rhytisma colonize the leaves of trees and shrubs and are particularly sensitive to the concentration of SO2 in the air, but nobody has looked for this fungus on this host in the past. Yet, presently, we were able to find Rhytisma fungus in Karkonosze Mts. Phytopathological monitoring was conducted in the years of 2014-2015 in the sub-alpine zone of the Karkonosze (Giant) Mts. It has been shown that, compared to similar studies conducted in the 1990s of the twentieth century, the species composition of fungi infesting Rubus chamaemorus and Betula carpactica has changed. Is this the beginning of changes that will occur in populations of plants?

TI Multitemporal analysis of forest fragmentation in Hindu Kush Himalaya-a
   case study from Khangchendzonga Biosphere Reserve, Sikkim, India
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB Forests in the mountains are a treasure trove; harbour a large biodiversity; and provide fodder, firewood, timber and non-timber forest products; all of these are essential for human survival in the highest mountains on earth. The present paper attempts a spatiotemporal assessment of forest fragmentation and changes in land use land cover ( LULC) pattern using multitemporal satellite data over a time span of around a decade ( 2000-2009), within the third highest protected area ( PA) in the world. The fragmentation analysis using Landscape Fragmentation Tool ( LFT) depicts a decrease in large core, edge and patches areas by 5.93, 3.64 and 0.66 %, respectively, while an increase in non-forest and perforated areas by 6.59 and 4.01 %, respectively. The land cover dynamics shows a decrease in open forest, alpine scrub, alpine meadows, snow and hill shadow areas by 2.81, 0.39, 8.18, 3.46 and 0.60 %, respectively, and there is an increase in dense forest and glacier area by 4.79 and 10.65 %, respectively. The change analysis shows a major transformation in areas from open forest to dense forest and from alpine meadows to alpine scrub. In order to quantify changes induced by forest fragmentation and to characterize composition and configuration of LULC mosaics, fragmentation indices were computed using Fragstats at class level, showing the signs of accelerated fragmentation. The outcome of the analysis revealed the effectiveness of geospatial tools coupled with landscape ecology in characterization and quantification of forest fragmentation and land cover changes. The present study provides a baseline database for sustainable conservation planning that will benefit the subsistence livelihoods in the region. Recommendations made based on the present analysis will help to recover forest and halt the pessimistic effects of fragmentation and land cover changes on biodiversity and ecosystem services in the region.

TI Trichloroethylene (TCE) in tree cores to complement a subsurface
   investigation on residential property near a former electroplating
   facility
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB Tree cores were collected and analyzed for trichloroethylene ( TCE) on a private property between a former electroplating facility in Asheville, North Carolina ( USA), and a contaminated wetland/spring complex. TCE was detected in 16 of 31 trees, the locations of which were largely consistent with a "plume core" delineated by a more detailed subsurface investigation nearly 2 years later. Concentrations in tree cores and nearby soil borings were not correlated, perhaps due to heterogeneities in both geologic and tree root structure, spatial and temporal variability in transpiration rates, or interferences caused by other contaminants at the site. Several tree cores without TCE provided evidence for significantly lower TCE concentrations in shallow groundwater along the margins of the contaminated spring complex in an area with limited accessibility. This study demonstrates that tree core analyses can complement a more extensive subsurface investigation, particularly in residential or ecologically sensitive areas.

TI Influence of game crops on the distribution and productivity of
   red-legged partridges Alectoris rufa in Mediterranean woodlands
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH
AB Red-legged partridges Alectoris rufa are one of the most important game species in extensively managed Mediterranean agro-forest systems. Population declines have led to management to increase their populations. This includes the creation of game crops, but their efficacy for red-legged partridges has not been tested. We developed in October 1996 an experimental introduction of 32 100 x 8 m plots in a 6.46-km(2) mixed agro-forest system area in Portugal. These plots were planted with either lupin Lupinus sp., vetch Vicea sp. or triticale Triticum aestivum x Secale cereale. The main goal of this study was the evaluation of the potential effect of game crops on partridge distribution and productivity, after controlling for the effect of habitat or other management actions. Partridge abundance and distribution were assessed during spring and summer 1997 by intensive territory mapping. We compared characteristics of territory centres with those of random points in relation to land uses, game crops, and location of water points or supplementary grain sites. The most important variable explaining partridge's location in spring was the density of supplementary water points. In summer, partridge territories were positively associated with the density of water points and lupin game crops, as well as olive trees. Productivity (number of young per territory in relation to adults observed) increased with the density of lupin game crops, but decreased with density of water points and vetch game crops and proportion of woodland within the territories. Overall, this study suggests that management for partridges in areas of agricultural abandonment, such as those in Mediterranean woodlands, would benefit from the introduction of leguminous game crops and water provision, though more studies are required for a more adequate optimization of these measures of habitat improvement, in particular about the specific cover of the crops and their spatial distribution so they provide adequate resources in summer for nestlings.

TI YIELD AND NITROGEN RECOVERY OF RAPE (BRASSICA NAPUS L.) IN RESPONSE TO
   APPLICATION OF LEGUMINOUS LEAF LITTER AND SUPPLEMENTAL INORGANIC
   NITROGEN
SO EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
AB The short term nutrient supply of Leucaena leucocephala, Calliandra calothyrsus, Acacia angustissima and Acacia karoo prunings with or without supplemental inorganic nitrogen were tested using rape (Brassica napus L.) in a field trial. Prunings were applied at a rate of 5 t ha(-1) to soil, alone or with supplemental N at 37.5 kg N ha(-1) (1/4 of recommended N). The respective decomposition and N release constants of the prunings were 9.15 and 9.70% for L. leucocephala; 6.15 and 6.40 for A. angustissima; 4.50 and 4.90 for C. calothyrsus; and 2.20 and 2.10 for A. karoo. These constants were best described by the (lignin+polyphenol)-to-nitrogen ratio of the prunings. Total biomass over the two seasons ranged from 1.40 to 17.28 t DM ha(-1) and total growth rates ranged from 2.34-26.70 g plant(-1) week(-1). The cumulative N recovery at week 9 ranged from 21.1-66.1 %. Legume tree leaves can be used as a source of N for vegetable production. Farmers who use high tannin leaf litter are recommended to supplement with mineral N in order to assure adequate N availability during plant growth.

TI The influence of vegetation on debris-flow initiation during extreme
   rainfall in the northern Colorado Front Range
SO GEOLOGY
AB We explored regional influences on debris-flow initiation throughout the Colorado Front Range (Colorado, USA) by exploiting a unique data set of more than 1100 debris flows that initiated during a 5 day rainstorm in 2013. Using geospatial data, we examined the influence of rain, hillslope angle, hillslope aspect, and vegetation density on debris-flow initiation. In particular we used a greenness index to differentiate areas of high tree density from grass and bare soil. The data demonstrated an overwhelming propensity for debris-flow initiation on south-facing hillslopes. However, when the debris-flow density was analyzed with respect to total rainfall and greenness we found that most debris flows occurred in areas of high rainfall and low tree density, regardless of hillslope aspect. These results indicate that present-day tree density exerts a stronger influence on debris-flow initiation locations than aspect-driven variations in soil and bedrock properties that developed over longer time scales.

TI Landslide susceptibility mapping at Gongliu county, China using
   artificial neural network and weight of evidence models
SO GEOSCIENCES JOURNAL
AB The aim of this study was to apply and to verify the use of artificial neural network (ANN) and weight of evidence (WoE) models to landslide susceptibility mapping in the Gongliu county, China, using a geographic information system (GIS). For this aim, in this study, a landslide inventory map was prepared using earlier reports and aerial photographs as well as by carrying out field surveys. A total of 163 landslides (70% out of 233 detected landslides) were randomly selected for model training, and the remaining 70 landslides (30%) were used for the model validation. Then, a total number of twelve landslide conditioning factors, such as slope angle, slope aspect, general curvature, plan curvature, profile curvature, altitude, distance to rivers, distance to roads, lithology, rainfall, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and sediment transport index (STI), were used in the analysis. Landslide hazardous areas were analyzed and mapped using the landslide-occurrence factors by ANN and WoE models. Finally the output maps were validated using the area under the curve (AUC) method. The validation results showed that the ANN model with a success rate of 82.51% and predictive accuracy of 77.31% performs better than WoE (success rate, 79.82%; predictive accuracy, 74.59%) model. Overall, both models showed almost similar results. Therefore, the two landslide susceptibility maps obtained were successful and can be useful for preliminary general land use planning and hazard mitigation purpose.

TI Primary sclerosing cholangitis is characterised by intestinal dysbiosis
   independent from IBD
SO GUT
AB Objective Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease often leading to end-stage liver disease. Its pathogenesis remains largely unknown, although frequent concomitant IBD hints towards common factors underlying gut and bile duct inflammation. Considering the mounting evidence on the involvement of the intestinal microbiota in initiating and determining IBD phenotype, we investigated intestinal microbiota composition in patients with PSC.
   Design Stool samples were collected from 147 individuals (52 patients with PSC, 52 age, gender and body mass index-matched healthy volunteers, 13 UC and 30 patients with Crohn's disease). An independent validation cohort of 14 PSC and 14 matched controls was recruited. 16S rDNA sequencing of faecal DNA was performed (Illumina MiSeq).
   Results The microbiota of patients with PSC was characterised by decreased microbiota diversity, and a significant overrepresentation of Enterococcus (p=3.76-e05), Fusobacterium (p=3.76e-05) and Lactobacillus (p=0.0002) genera. This dysbiosis was present in patients with PSC with and without concomitant IBD and was distinct from IBD, and independent of treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid. A decision tree based on abundances of these three genera allowed reliable classification in the validation cohort. In particular, one operational taxonomic unit belonging to the Enterococcus genus was associated with increased levels of serum alkaline phosphatase (p=0.048), a marker of disease severity.
   Conclusions We here present the first report of PSC-associated faecal dysbiosis, independent from IBD signatures, suggesting the intestinal microbiota could be a contributing factor in PSC pathogenesis. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and assess causality.

TI On the Construction of Data Aggregation Tree with Minimum Energy Cost in
   Wireless Sensor Networks: NP-Completeness and Approximation Algorithms
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS
AB In many applications, it is a basic operation for the sink to periodically collect reports from all sensors. Since the data gathering process usually proceeds for many rounds, it is important to collect these data efficiently, that is, to reduce the energy cost of data transmission. Under such applications, a tree is usually adopted as the routing structure to save the computation costs for maintaining the routing tables of sensors. In this paper, we work on the problem of constructing a data aggregation tree that minimizes the total energy cost of data transmission in a wireless sensor network. In addition, we also address such a problem in the wireless sensor network where relay nodes exist and consider the cases where the link quality is not perfect. We show that these problems are NP-complete and propose O(1)-approximation algorithms for each of them. Simulations show that the proposed algorithms have good performance in terms of energy cost.

TI Global and Local Information in Clustering Labeled Block Models
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB The stochastic block model is a classical cluster-exhibiting random graph model that has been widely studied in statistics, physics, and computer science. In its simplest form, the model is a random graph with two equal-sized clusters, with intracluster edge probability p, and intercluster edge probability q. We focus on the sparse case, i.e., p, q = O(1/n), which is practically more relevant and also mathematically more challenging. A conjecture of Decelle, Krzakala, Moore, and Zdeborova, based on ideas from statistical physics, predicted a specific threshold for clustering. The negative direction of the conjecture was proved by Mossel, Neeman, and Sly (2012), and more recently, the positive direction was independently proved by Massoulie and Mossel, Neeman, and Sly. In many real network clustering problems, nodes contain information as well. We study the interplay between node and network information in clustering by studying a labeled block model, where in addition to the edge information, the true cluster labels of a small fraction of the nodes are revealed. In the case of two clusters, we show that below the threshold, a small amount of node information does not affect recovery. On the other hand, we show that for any small amount of information, efficient local clustering is achievable as long as the number of clusters is sufficiently large (as a function of the amount of revealed information).

TI Mining Suspicious Tax Evasion Groups in Big Data
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING
AB There is evidence that an increasing number of enterprises plot together to evade tax in an unperceived way. At the same time, the taxation information related data is a classic kind of big data. These issues challenge the effectiveness of traditional data mining-based tax evasion detection methods. To address this problem, we first investigate the classic tax evasion cases, and employ a graph-based method to characterize their property that describes two suspicious relationship trails with a same antecedent node behind an Interest-Affiliated Transaction (IAT). Next, we propose a Colored Network-Based Model (CNBM) for characterizing economic behaviors, social relationships, and the IATs between taxpayers, and generating a Taxpayer Interest Interacted Network (TPIIN). To accomplish the tax evasion detection task by discovering suspicious groups in a TPIIN, methods for building a patterns tree and matching component patterns are introduced and the completeness of the methods based on graph theory is presented. Then, we describe an experiment based on real data and a simulated network. The experimental results show that our proposed method greatly improves the efficiency of tax evasion detection, as well as provides a clear explanation of the tax evasion behaviors of taxpayer groups.

TI ML-FOREST: A Multi-Label Tree Ensemble Method for Multi-Label
   Classification
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING
AB Multi-label classification deals with the problem where each example is associated with multiple class labels. Since the labels are often dependent to other labels, exploiting label dependencies can significantly improve the multi-label classification performance. The label dependency in existing studies is often given as prior knowledge or learned from the labels only. However, in many real applications, such prior knowledge may not be available, or labeled information might be very limited. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, called ML-FOREST, to learn an ensemble of hierarchical multi-label classifier trees to reveal the intrinsic label dependencies. In ML-FOREST, we construct a set of hierarchical trees, and develop a label transfer mechanism to identify the multiple relevant labels in a hierarchical way. In general, the relevant labels at higher levels of the trees capture more discriminable label concepts, and they will be transferred into lower level children nodes that are harder to discriminate. The relevant labels in the hierarchy are then aggregated to compute label dependency and make the final prediction. Our empirical study shows encouraging results of the proposed algorithm in comparison with the state-of-the-art multi-label classification algorithms under Friedman test and post-hoc Nemenyi test.

TI Mutually Beneficial Confluent Routing
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING
AB We investigate a new multi-user routing problem: mutually beneficial confluent routing (MCR). In the MCR, every user has his/her own source and destination; confluences of user routes occur so that users can mutually benefit from travelling together on the confluences. The idea of gaining benefit from travelling together is valuable in various practical applications, such as ride sharing, delivery routing, and pedestrian navigation. We formulate the MCR as a new combinatorial optimization problem on road networks. The MCR is more general and complex than single vehicle routing problems, ride-sharing problems, and the Steiner tree problem. We propose exact and efficient algorithms for the MCR for the setting of two or three users. The setting is reasonable for various practical applications. The key ideas of our algorithms are to use "confluence patterns" of the optimal solutions and exploit the properties of geometric graphs. Experimental results obtained on large scale road networks reveal that our algorithms are sufficiently efficient.

TI Deadline Guaranteed Service for Multi-Tenant Cloud Storage
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS
AB It is imperative for cloud storage systems to be able to provide deadline guaranteed services according to service level agreements (SLAs) for online services. In spite of many previous works on deadline aware solutions, most of them focus on scheduling work flows or resource reservation in datacenter networks but neglect the server overload problem in cloud storage systems that prevents providing the deadline guaranteed services. In this paper, we introduce a new form of SLAs, which enables each tenant to specify a percentage of its requests it wishes to serve within a specified deadline. We first identify the multiple objectives (i.e., traffic and latency minimization, resource utilization maximization) in developing schemes to satisfy the SLAs. To satisfy the SLAs while achieving the multi-objectives, we propose a Parallel Deadline Guaranteed (PDG) scheme, which schedules data reallocation (through load reassignment and data replication) using a tree-based bottom-up parallel process. The observation from our model also motivates our deadline strictness clustered data allocation algorithm that maps tenants with the similar SLA strictness into the same server to enhance SLA guarantees. We further enhance PDG in supplying SLA guaranteed services through two algorithms: i) a prioritized data reallocation algorithm that deals with request arrival rate variation, and ii) an adaptive request retransmission algorithm that deals with SLA requirement variation. Our trace-driven experiments on a simulator and Amazon EC2 show the effectiveness of our schemes for guaranteeing the SLAs while achieving the multi-objectives.

TI PathGraph: A Path Centric Graph Processing System
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS
AB Large scale iterative graph computation presents an interesting systems challenge due to two well known problems: (1) the lack of access locality and (2) the lack of storage efficiency. This paper presents PathGraph, a system for improving iterative graph computation on graphs with billions of edges. First, we improve the memory and disk access locality for iterative computation algorithms on large graphs by modeling a large graph using a collection of tree-based partitions. This enables us to use path-centric computation rather than vertex-centric or edge-centric computation. For each tree partition, we re-label vertices using DFS in order to preserve consistency between the order of vertex ids and vertex order in the paths. Second, a compact storage that is optimized for iterative graph parallel computation is developed in the PathGraph system. Concretely, we employ delta-compression and store tree-based partitions in a DFS order. By clustering highly correlated paths together as tree based partitions, we maximize sequential access and minimize random access on storage media. Third but not the least, our path-centric computation model is implemented using a scatter/gather programming model. We parallel the iterative computation at partition tree level and perform sequential local updates for vertices in each tree partition to improve the convergence speed. To provide well balanced workloads among parallel threads at tree partition level, we introduce the concept of multiple stealing points based task queue to allow work stealings from multiple points in the task queue. We evaluate the effectiveness of PathGraph by comparing with recent representative graph processing systems such as GraphChi and X-Stream etc. Our experimental results show that our approach outperforms the two systems on a number of graph algorithms for both in-memory and out-of-core graphs. While our approach achieves better data balance and load balance, it also shows better speedup than the two systems with the growth of threads.

AB Virtualization of servers and networks is a key technique to resolve the conflict between the increasing demands on computing power and the high cost of hardware in data centers. In order to map virtual networks to physical infrastructure efficiently, designers have to make careful decisions on the allocation of limited resources, which makes placement of virtual networks in data centers a critical issue. In this paper, we study the placement of virtual networks in fat-tree data center networks. In order to meet the requirements of instant parallel data transfer between multiple computing units, we propose a model of multicast-capable virtual networks (MVNs). We then design four virtual machine (VM) placement schemes to embed MVNs into fat-tree data center networks, named Most-Vacant-Fit (MVF), Most-Compact-First (MCF), Mixed-Bidirectional-Fill (MBF), and Malleable-Shallow-Fill (MSF). All these VM placement schemes guarantee the nonblocking multicast capability of each MVN while simultaneously achieving significant saving in the cost of network hardware. In addition, each VM placement scheme has its unique features. The MVF scheme has zero interference to existing computing tasks in data centers; the MCF scheme leads to the greatest cost saving; the MBF scheme simultaneously possesses the merits of MVF and MCF, and it provides an adjustable parameter allowing cloud providers to achieve preferred balance between the cost and the overhead; the MSF scheme performs at least as well as MBF, and possesses some additional predictable features. Finally, we compare the performance and overhead of these VM placement schemes, and present simulation results to validate the theoretical results.

TI Clustering Tree-Structured Data on Manifold
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Tree-structured data usually contain both topological and geometrical information, and are necessarily considered on manifold instead of euclidean space for appropriate data parameterization and analysis. In this study, we propose a novel tree-structured data parameterization, called Topology-Attribute matrix (T-A matrix), so the data clustering task can be conducted on matrix manifold. We incorporate the structure constraints embedded in data into the non-negative matrix factorization method to determine meta-trees from the T-A matrix, and the signature vector of each single tree can then be extracted by meta-tree decomposition. The meta-tree space turns out to be a cone space, in which we explore the distance metric and implement the clustering algorithm based on the concepts like Frechet mean. Finally, the T-A matrix based clustering (TAMBAC) framework is evaluated and compared using both simulated data and real retinal images to illustrate its efficiency and accuracy.

TI Multimodel-Based Incident Prediction and Risk Assessment in Dynamic
   Cybersecurity Protection for Industrial Control Systems
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN CYBERNETICS-SYSTEMS
AB Currently, an increasing number of information/communication technologies are adopted into the industrial control systems (ICSs). While these IT technologies offer high flexibility, interoperability, and convenient administration of ICSs, they also introduce cybersecurity risks. Dynamic cybersecurity risk assessment is a key foundational component of security protection. However, due to the characteristics of ICSs, the risk assessment for IT systems is not completely applicable for ICSs. In this paper, through the consideration of the characteristics of ICSs, a targeted multilevel Bayesian network containing attack, function, and incident models is proposed. Following this proposal, a novel multimodel-based hazardous incident prediction approach is designed. On this basis, a dynamic cybersecurity risk assessment approach, which has the ability to assess the risk caused by unknown attacks, is also devised. Furthermore, to improve the accuracy of the risk assessment, which may be reduced by the redundant accumulation of overlaps amongst different consequences, a unified consequence quantification method is presented. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a simulation of a simplified chemical reactor control system is conducted in MATLAB. The simulation results can clearly demonstrate that the proposed approach has the ability to dynamically calculate the cybersecurity risk of ICSs in a timely manner. Additionally, the result of a different comparative simulation shows that our approach has the ability to assess the risk caused by unknown attacks.

TI Speeding up maximal fully-correlated itemsets search in large databases
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING AND CYBERNETICS
AB Finding the most interesting correlations among items is essential for problems in many commercial, medical, and scientific domains. Our previous work on the maximal fully-correlated itemset (MFCI) framework can rule out the itemsets with irrelevant items and its down-ward-closed property helps to achieve good computational performance. However, to calculate the desired MFCIs in large databases, there are still two computational issues. First, unlike finding maximal frequent itemsets which can start the pruning from 1-itemsets, finding MFCIs must start the pruning from 2-itemsets. When the number of items in a given dataset is large and the support of all the pairs cannot be loaded into the memory, the IO cost (O(n(2))) for calculating correlation of all the pairs can be very high. Second, users usually need to try different correlation thresholds for different desirable MFCIs. Therefore, the cost of processing the Apriori procedure each time for a different correlation threshold is also very high. Consequently, we proposed two techniques to solve these problems. First, we identify the correlation upper bound for any good correlation measure to avoid unnecessary IO query for the support of pairs, and make use of their common monotone property to prune many pairs even without computing their correlation upper bounds. In addition, we build an enumeration tree to save the fully-correlated value for all the MFCIs under a given initial correlation threshold. We can either efficiently retrieve the desired MFCIs for any given threshold above the initial threshold or incrementally grow the tree if the given threshold is below the initial threshold. Experimental results show that our algorithm can be an order of magnitude faster than the original MFCI algorithm.

TI A new estimate of mutual information based measure of dependence between
   two variables: properties and fast implementation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING AND CYBERNETICS
AB This article proposes a new method to estimate an existing mutual information based dependence measure using histogram density estimates. Finding a suitable bin length for histogram is an open problem. We propose a new way of computing the bin length for histogram using a function of maximum separation between points. The chosen bin length leads to consistent density estimates for histogram method. The values of density thus obtained are used to calculate an estimate of an existing dependence measure. The proposed estimate is named as Mutual Information Based Dependence Index (MIDI). Some important properties of MIDI have also been stated. The performance of the proposed method has been compared to generally accepted measures like Distance Correlation (dcor), Maximal Information Coefficient (MINE) in terms of accuracy and computational complexity with the help of several artificial data sets with different amounts of noise. The proposed method is able to detect many types of relationships between variables, without making any assumption about the functional form of the relationship. The power statistics of proposed method illustrate their effectiveness in detecting non linear relationship. Thus, it is able to achieve generality without a high rate of false positive cases. MIDI is found to work better on a real life data set than competing methods. The proposed method is found to overcome some of the limitations which occur with dcor and MINE. Computationally, MIDI is found to be better than dcor and MINE, in terms of time and memory, making it suitable for large data sets.

TI Allergic sensitization prevalence in a children and adolescent
   population of northeastern Greece region
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY
AB Objectives: To evaluate the prevalence of allergic sensitization in a childhood and adolescent population, to explore age-and gender-specific variations and finally to discover co-sensitivities among allergens.
   Methods: A two-stage cross-sectional survey among school-aged children. The two stages of the study involved enrollment of schools and then skin prick testing (SPT) within schools. A total of 675 school children were included in the study. Of those, 231 were diagnosed with allergic rhinitis (AR), according to the medical history as provided by parental-completed questionnaires and positive SPT results. The antigen panel consisted of common allergens and more specifically house dust mites-HDM (Dermatophagoides farinae and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus), grass mix, trees (olive, cypress and pine), weeds (Parietaria spp.), cat and dog epithelium and moulds (Alternaria spp., Cladosporium spp.). The SPT sensitivity was graded according to SPT-USA Standards.
   Results: The overall prevalence rate of AR was 34.22%. In total, 93 school children (40.3%) were mono and 138 (59.7%) were poly-sensitized. Overall, the most prevalent sensitizations in decreasing order were to HDM (59.74%), to grasses (48.9%), to Alternaria (34.6%) and to olive (14.71%). There were no age-and sex-specific differences, except for Alternaria mould that showed a significant prevalence among primary school-aged children and predominance in the female gender, by contrast to grass pollen allergy that was predominant to males. A 32% of SPT-positive individuals were not aware of their allergy, with no statistically significant differences between ages. Co-sensitivities were detected for grass pollens and pine and olive trees, for Alternaria and Cladosporium moulds, for cypress and pine trees, and finally for dog and cat danders.
   Conclusions: Given data among school-aged children should be a baseline from which to monitor disease trends and is considered important for the optimal management of AR patients. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Robotic adversarial coverage of known environments
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS RESEARCH
AB Coverage is a fundamental problem in robotics, where one or more robots are required to visit each point in a target area at least once. Most previous work has concentrated on finding a coverage path that would minimize the coverage time. In this paper, we consider a new and more general version of the problem: adversarial coverage. Here, the robot operates in an environment that contains threats that might stop the robot. The objective is to cover the target area as quickly as possible, while minimizing the probability that the robot will be stopped before completing the coverage. This version of the problem has many real-world applications, from performing coverage missions in hazardous fields such as nuclear power plants, to surveillance of enemy forces in the battlefield and field demining. In this paper, we discuss the offline version of adversarial coverage, in which a map of the threats is given to the robot in advance. First, we formally define the adversarial coverage problem and present different optimization criteria used to evaluate coverage algorithms in adversarial environments. We show that finding an optimal solution to the adversarial coverage problem is -hard. We therefore suggest two heuristic algorithms: STAC, a spanning-tree-based coverage algorithm, and GAC, which follows a greedy approach. We establish theoretical bounds on the total risk involved in the coverage paths created by these algorithms and on their lengths. Lastly, we compare the effectiveness of these two algorithms in various environments and settings.

TI Fast probabilistic collision checking for sampling-based motion planning
   using locality-sensitive hashing
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS RESEARCH
AB We present a novel approach to perform fast probabilistic collision checking in high-dimensional configuration spaces to accelerate the performance of sampling-based motion planning. Our formulation stores the results of prior collision queries, and then uses such information to predict the collision probability for a new configuration sample. In particular, we perform an approximate k-NN (k-nearest neighbor) search to find prior query samples that are closest to the new query configuration. The new query sample's collision status is then estimated according to the collision checking results of these prior query samples, based on the fact that nearby configurations are likely to have the same collision status. We use locality-sensitive hashing techniques with sub-linear time complexity for approximate k-NN queries. We evaluate the benefit of our probabilistic collision checking approach by integrating it with a wide variety of sampling-based motion planners, including PRM (Probabilistic roadmaps), lazyPRM, RRT Rapidly exploring random trees, and RRT*. Our method can improve these planners in various manners, such as accelerating the local path validation, or computing an efficient order for the graph search on the roadmap. Experiments on a set of benchmarks demonstrate the performance of our method, and we observe up to 2x speedup in the performance of planners on rigid and articulated robots.

TI In vitro gas production of foliage from three browse tree species
   treated with different dose levels of exogenous fibrolytic enzymes
SO JOURNAL OF ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY AND ANIMAL NUTRITION
AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different dose levels of exogenous fibrolytic enzymes (EFE) on invitro ruminal fermentation kinetics and energy utilization of foliages from three browse trees (Pithecellobium dulce, Heliocarpus velutinus and Guazuma ulmifolia). Mixture of EFE product was added to the leaves of the three browse tree species at three dose levels: 0 (control), 3.5 and 7.0mg/g of DM. Chemical composition of the foliages, including plant secondary metabolites such as total phenolics (TP), saponins (SAP) and aqueous fraction (AF), was determined. In addition, invitro assaying of ruminal gas production kinetics was determined for the three browse three foliages treated with EFE. P.dulce had the highest crude protein content (p<0.05), whereas G.ulmifolia had the highest content of neutral detergent fibre and SAP (p<0.05) and H.velutinus had the lowest content of TP (p<0.05). The interaction between tree species and dose level of EFE was significant (p<0.05) for gas production (GP) at 24h of incubation, parameters b and c of the accumulated GP curve, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and metabolizable energy (ME). The lowest (p<0.01) extent of accumulated GP as well as the b and c values occurred in G.ulmifolia at 0mg EFE/g DM. P.dulce had the highest (p<0.05) values for ME and SCFA at the highest dose of EFE. Tree species and dose level had significant (p<0.05) effects on all parameters describing invitro ruminal fermentation kinetics and energy utilization. Addition of EFE improved the fermentation kinetics of the browse species considered in this study.

TI A Nonparametric Bayesian Analysis of Heterogenous Treatment Effects in
   Digital Experimentation
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS & ECONOMIC STATISTICS
AB Randomized controlled trials play an important role in how Internet companies predict the impact of policy decisions and product changes. In these "digital experiments," different units (people, devices, products) respond differently to the treatment. This article presents a fast and scalable Bayesian nonparametric analysis of such heterogenous treatment effects and their measurement in relation to observable covariates. New results and algorithms are provided for quantifying the uncertainty associated with treatment effect measurement via both linear projections and nonlinear regression trees (CART and random forests). For linear projections, our inference strategy leads to results that are mostly in agreement with those from the frequentist literature. We find that linear regression adjustment of treatment effect averages (i.e., post stratification) can provide some variance reduction, but that this reduction will be vanishingly. small in the low-signal and large-sample setting of digital experiments. For regression trees, we provide uncertainty quantification for the machine learning algorithms that are commonly applied in tree-fitting. We argue that practitioners should look to ensembles of trees (forests) rather than individual trees in their analysis. The ideas are applied on and illustrated through an example experiment involving 21 million unique users of EBay.com.

TI Some Methods for Analyzing Big Dependent Data
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS & ECONOMIC STATISTICS
AB We consider an approach to analyze big data of time series. Big dependent data are first transformed into functional time series of densities via nonparametric density estimation. We then discuss some tools for exploratory data analysis of the resulting functional time series. The tools employed include K-means cluster analysis and tree-based classification. For modeling, we propose a threshold approximate-factor model and a Hellinger distance autoregressive model for functional time series of continuous densities. The latent factors of factor models are estimated by functional principal component analysis. Cross-validation and Hellinger distance are used to select the number of principal component functions. For prediction of high-dimensional time series, we use the results of cluster analysis to obtain parsimonious models. We demonstrate the proposed analysis by considering the demand of electricity, the behavior of daily U.S. stock returns, and U.S. income distributions.

SO JOURNAL OF ELASTOMERS AND PLASTICS
AB Fusion is a key parameter in achieving polyvinyl chloride (PVC) nanocomposites with desired properties. In the present research, a fuzzy logic (FL)-based model is developed to predict fusion time (FT) for the contents of nanoclay, processing aid, and calcium stearate in PVC processing. In order to have precise rules for the FL model, data mining algorithm RepTree is employed to detect dominating patterns among experimental data. The model parameters are then well adjusted using genetic algorithm. The modeling results show a correlation of 0.86 between predicted and observed values for FT. So, it proved reliability of the idea of employing the decision tree resulted from a data mining algorithm as the base knowledge of FL models. Also, applying genetic algorithm optimization, the correlation coefficient increased from a value of less than 0.83 to 0.86. The calculated correlation coefficient for the test data was 0.88, which denotes good model universalizing ability.

Total soil concentrations of all pollutants except Tl were high, up to 156 mg As kg(-1), 62.9 mg Cd kg(-1), 2853 mg Pb kg(-1), 3.6 mg Tl kg(-1) and 13,508 mg Zn kg(-1). Element concentrations in the tissues of herbaceous plants depended on plant species and organ (shoot vs. root). Cd, Pb, Tl and Zn, but not As, were elevated in both herb species and F. sylvatica in comparison to reference values, reaching up to 0.21 mg As kg(-1), 47.4 mg Pb kg(-1) and 8.2 mg Tl kg(-1) in roots of M. perennis, and 63.6 mg Cd kg(-1) and 752 mg Zn kg(-1) in roots of M. nutans. The efficiency of pollutant transfer from soil to roots and/or shoots varied among plant species and elements. Some heavy metals were effectively taken up from soil (Cd, Tl) or translocated to shoots (Cd, Zn), though it depended on plant species. Our study indicates a risk of the dispersion of heavy metals in the environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Simulation of Mulch and No-Mulch Conditions for Various Soil Matric
   Potential Thresholds for Drip-Fertigated Guava (Psidium guajava L.) in
   the Semiarid Region of Northwest India
SO JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING
AB Field experiments were conducted in a semiarid region of Punjab state, northwest India, for 2years to evaluate an efficient irrigation schedule for guava under mulch and no-mulch conditions. The experiment involved the effect of mulching and three irrigation threshold values [I1 (-20kPa); I2 (-40kPa); and I3 (-60kPa)] on guava plants under drip irrigation and fertigation. Soil matric potential, irrigation amount, soil water content, and fertilizer (N, P, and K) content were measured, and seasonal crop evapotranspiration as well as water and fertilizer use efficiency were computed regularly during the growing period of the crop. The calibrated two dimensional (2D)/three-dimensional (3D) model was used to simulate soil matric potential, and water and fertilizer movement in the soil under guava trees for mulch and no-mulch conditions. Simulated water movement, soil matric potential, and N, P, and K movement statistically matched those measured using the tensiometers, soil water probes, and soil sampling techniques. Results show that for mulch plants, if no irrigation was applied for a period extending to 6-7days, i.e.,for I3 (-60kPa), irrigation treatment and dry periods without rainfall, the soil matric potential was lower for mulch plants than for no-mulch plants. Statistical measures [root mean square error (RMSE), average absolute error (AAE), relative root mean square error (RRMSE), correlation coefficient (r2), and model efficiency (EF)] indicate a close correspondence between measured and simulated values. The modeling efficiency (EF) and the root-mean square error (RMSE) for soil matric potential varied from 0.80 to 0.95 and 4.07 to 8.35kPa, respectively, and for fertilizer movement from 0.61 to 0.87 and 0.0094 to 1.78mg/cm-1, respectively. A water and mass balance was performed using commercially available software to estimate the water and fertilizer (N, P, and K) performances and relate these with amount of water and fertilizer applied. Modeling also revealed that lower leaching losses was for -40kPa soil matric potential. The amount and frequency of irrigation application at this soil matric potential perfectly suited the growth of the plants. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

TI The GRACE Checklist: A Validated Assessment Tool for High Quality
   Observational Studies of Comparative Effectiveness
SO JOURNAL OF MANAGED CARE & SPECIALTY PHARMACY
AB BACKGROUND: Recognizing the growing need for robust evidence about treatment effectiveness in real-world populations, the Good Research for Comparative Effectiveness (GRACE) guidelines have been developed for noninterventional studies of comparative effectiveness to determine which studies are sufficiently rigorous to be reliable enough for use in health technology assessments.
   OBJECTIVE: To evaluate which aspects of the GRACE Checklist contribute most strongly to recognition of quality.
   METHODS: We assembled 28 observational comparative effectiveness articles published from 2001 to 2010 that compared treatment effectiveness and/or safety of drugs, medical devices, and medical procedures. Twenty-two volunteers from academia, pharmaceutical companies, and government agencies applied the GRACE Checklist to those articles, providing 56 assessments. Ten senior academic and industry experts provided assessments of overall article quality for the purpose of decision support. We also rated each article based on the number of annual citations and impact factor of the journal in which the article was published. To identify checklist items that were most predictive of quality, classification and regression tree (CART) analysis, a binary, recursive, partitioning methodology, was used to create 3 decision trees, which compared the 56 article assessments with 3 external quality outcomes: (1) expert assessment of overall quality, (2) citation frequency, and (3) impact factor. A fourth tree looked at the composite outcome of all 3 quality indicators.
   RESULTS: The best predictors of quality included the following: use of concurrent comparators, limiting the study to new initiators of the study drug, equivalent measurement of outcomes in study groups, collecting data on most if not all known confounders or effect modifiers, accounting for immortal time bias in the analysis, and use of sensitivity analyses to test how much effect estimates depended on various assumptions. Only sensitivity analyses appeared consistently as a predictor of quality in all 4 trees. When a composite outcome of the 3 quality measures was used, the GRACE Checklist showed high sensitivity and specificity (71.43% and 80.95%, respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS: The GRACE Checklist stands out from other consensus driven and expert guidance documents because of its extensive validation efforts.

TI ON THE NUMBER OF DEDEKIND CUTS AND TWO-CARDINAL MODELS OF DEPENDENT
   THEORIES
SO JOURNAL OF THE INSTITUTE OF MATHEMATICS OF JUSSIEU
AB For an infinite cardinal kappa, let ded kappa denote the supremum of the number of Dedekind cuts in linear orders of size kappa. It is known that kappa < ded kappa <= 2(kappa) for all kappa and that ded kappa < 2(kappa) is consistent for any kappa of uncountable cofinality. We prove however that 2(kappa) <= ded(ded(ded(ded kappa))) always holds. Using this result we calculate the Hanf numbers for the existence of two-cardinal models with arbitrarily large gaps and for the existence of arbitrarily large models omitting a type in the class of countable dependent first-order theories. Specifically, we show that these bounds are as large as in the class of all countable theories.

TI Computational complexity allocation and control for inter-coding of high
   efficiency video coding with fast coding unit split decision
SO JOURNAL OF VISUAL COMMUNICATION AND IMAGE REPRESENTATION
AB HEVC provides the quadtree structure of the coding unit (CU) with four coding-tree depths to facilitate high coding efficiency. However, compared with previous standards, the HEVC encoder increases computational complexity considerably, thus making it inappropriate for applications in power-constrained devices. This study therefore proposes a computational complexity allocation and control method for the low-delay P-frame configuration of the HEVC encoder. The complexity allocation includes the group of pictures (GOP) layer, the frame layer, and the CU layer in the HEVC encoder. Each layer involved uses individual method to distribute the complexity. In particular, motion vector estimation information is applied for CU complexity allocation and depth split determination. The total computational complexity can thus be reduced to 80% and 60% or even lower. Experiment results revealed that the average BD-PSNR exhibited a decrease of approximately 0.1 dB and a BD-bitrate increment of 2% when the target complexity was reduced to 60%.

TI Improved road centerlines extraction in high-resolution remote sensing
   images using shear transform, directional morphological filtering and
   enhanced broken lines connection
SO JOURNAL OF VISUAL COMMUNICATION AND IMAGE REPRESENTATION
AB Road information plays an important role in many civilian and military applications. Road centerlines extraction from high-resolution remote sensing images can be used to update a transportation database. However, it is difficult to extract a complete road network from high-resolution images, especially when the color of road is close to that of background. This paper proposes an improved method for road centerlines extraction, which is based on shear transform, directional segmentation, shape features filtering, directional morphological filtering, tensor voting, multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and enhanced broken lines connection. The proposed method consists of five steps. Firstly, directional segmentation based on spectral information and shear transform is used to segment the images for obtaining the initial road map. Shear transform is introduced to overcome the disadvantage of the loss of the road segment information. Secondly, we perform hole filling to remove the holes due to noise in some road regions. Thirdly, reliable road segments are extracted by road shape features and directional morphological filtering. Directional morphological filtering can separate road from the neighboring non-road objects to ensure the independence of each road target candidate. Fourthly, tensor voting and MARS are exploited to extract smooth road centerlines, which overcome the shortcoming that the road centerlines extracted by the thinning algorithm have many spurs. Finally, we propose an enhanced broken lines connection algorithm to generate a complete road network, in which a new measure function is constructed and spectral similarity is introduced. We evaluate the performance on the high-resolution aerial and QuickBird satellite images. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is promising. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Geographic position and landscape composition explain regional patterns
   of migrating landbird distributions during spring stopover along the
   northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico
SO LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
AB Annual migration of landbirds across the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) presents a unique opportunity to examine extrinsic processes operating at various spatial scales in determining animal distributions.
   Our objectives were to comprehensively quantify bird stopover densities across the northern GOM coast and model broad-scale factors explaining distributional patterns.
   We used weather surveillance radars to measure reflectivity of birds aloft at onset of nocturnal migratory flights and estimate bird stopover densities during four springs (2009-2012) for 6.7 million ha along the GOM. We aggregated bird densities to one longitudinal degree and 3 km of proximity to coast.
   Boosted Regression Tree models revealed that stopover density was related to year, longitude, proximity to coast, and amount of hardwood forest cover in the landscape. Average longitudinal patterns supported previous studies of broad-scale trans-Gulf migrant arrivals with highest density in Louisiana (92-93A degrees W) and lowest in Alabama (88-89A degrees W). Florida (83-84A degrees W) supported a second peak in migrant density, suggesting an eastern trans-Gulf route or contribution from trans-Caribbean migrants. Longitudinal patterns in migrant distributions varied strongly between years and appear generally related to variability in GOM wind patterns. Densities increased with proximity to coast, highlighting constraints on migrants to travel inland, especially in Florida's panhandle. Despite this, density was positively related to amount of forest cover more steeply along the immediate coast.
   Broad-scale stopover distributions of migrating landbirds along the GOM coast are heavily influenced by geographic constraints in the context of the GOM acting as a barrier to landbird migration.

TI Multi-scale assessment of human-induced changes to Amazonian instream
   habitats
SO LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
AB Land use change and forest degradation have myriad effects on tropical ecosystems. Yet their consequences for low-order streams remain very poorly understood, including in the worldA ' s largest freshwater basin, the Amazon.
   Determine the degree to which physical and chemical characteristics of the instream habitat of low-order Amazonian streams change in response to past local- and catchment-level anthropogenic disturbances.
   To do so, we collected field instream habitat (i.e., physical habitat and water quality) and landscape data from 99 stream sites in two eastern Brazilian Amazon regions. We used random forest regression trees to assess the relative importance of different predictor variables in determining changes in instream habitat response variables.
   Multiple drivers, operating at multiple spatial scales, were important in determining changes in the physical habitat and water quality of the sites. Although we found few similarities in modelled relationships between the two regions, we observed non-linear responses of specific instream characteristics to landscape change; for example 20 % of catchment deforestation resulted in consistently warmer streams.
   Our results highlight the importance of local riparian and catchment-scale forest cover in shaping instream physical environments, but also underscore the importance of other land use changes and activities, such as road crossings and upstream agriculture intensification. In contrast to the property-scale focus of the Brazilian Forest code, which governs environmental regulations on private land, our results reinforce the importance of catchment-wide management strategies to protect stream ecosystem integrity.

TI Testing remotely-sensed predictors of meso-carnivore habitat use in
   Mediterranean ecosystems
SO LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
AB The legacy of human use of Mediterranean ecosystems results in spatial and temporal heterogeneity of resources for wildlife. Understanding wildlife use of these ecosystems may be improved by including information on ecosystem type, structure, and function extracted from remote sensing data.
   To assess whether we can improve our understanding of wildlife-habitat use by including information on ecosystem type, structure and function.
   We tested whether remote sensing derived descriptors of ecosystem type, structure (tree cover and patch size) and function (productivity and stress) determine the habitat of stone martens (Martes foina), common genets (Genetta genetta), and European badgers (Meles meles) in southern Portugal. We linked radio-tracking data from five stone martens, five genets and eight badgers with aerial photography, and some spectra-selectivity to classify vegetation, its structure, productivity and drought stress.
   Statistically-derived generalized linear mixed regression models using combinations of remotely sensed descriptors of ecosystem type, structure and function, performed better than single ecosystem type descriptors.
   Inclusion of information on ecosystem functioning in predictive models of habitat use is more informative than ecosystem type alone, suggesting functional relationships between wildlife and their habitat. However, inclusion of both ecosystem type and function maybe limited to finer spatial resolutions. Our results illustrate the untapped potential of remote sensing to provide detailed descriptors of habitat at adequate spatial scales, now that they are freely available and are systematically collected over space and time. This information adds useful insights on wildlife-habitat relationships under changing patterns of land use and climate.

TI Determinants of spread in an urban landscape by an introduced lizard
SO LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
AB Urban landscapes are a mixture of built structures, human-altered vegetation, and remnant semi-natural areas. The spatial arrangement of abiotic and biotic conditions resulting from urbanization doubtless influences the establishment and spread of non-native species in a city.
   We investigated the effects of habitat structure, thermal microclimates, and species coexistence on the spread of a non-native lizard (Anolis cristatellus) in the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida (USA).
   We used transect surveys to estimate lizard occurrence and abundance on trees and to measure vegetation characteristics, and we assessed forest cover and impervious surface using GIS. We sampled lizard body temperatures, habitat use, and relative abundance at multiple sites.
   At least one of five Anolis species occupied 79 % of the 1035 trees surveyed in primarily residential areas, and non-native A. cristatellus occupied 25 % of trees. Presence and abundance of A. cristatellus were strongly associated with forest patches, dense vegetation, and high canopy cover, which produced cooler microclimates suitable for this species. Presence of A. cristatellus was negatively associated with the ecologically similar non-native A. sagrei, resulting in reduced abundance and a shift in perch use of A. cristatellus.
   The limited spread of A. cristatellus in Miami over 35 years is due to the patchy, low-density distribution of wooded habitat, which limits dispersal by diffusion. The presence of congeners may also limit spread. Open habitats-some parks, yards and roadsides-contain few if any A. cristatellus, and colonization of isolated forest habitat appears to depend on human-mediated dispersal.

TI Movement patterns of three arboreal primates in a Neotropical moist
   forest explained by LiDAR-estimated canopy structure
SO LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
AB Many arboreal mammals in Neotropical forests are important seed dispersers that influence the spatial patterns of tree regeneration via their movement patterns, which in turn are determined by the canopy structure of the forest itself. However, the relationship between arboreal mammal movement and canopy structure is poorly understood, due in large part to the complexity of quantifying arboreal habitat structure.
   We relate detailed movement trajectories of three sympatric primate species to attributes of canopy structure derived from airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) in order to understand the role of structure in arboreal movement in the tropical moist forest of Barro Colorado Island, Panama.
   We used high-resolution LiDAR to quantify three-dimensional attributes of the forest canopy of the entire island, high-resolution GPS tracking to map the movement patterns of the monkey species, and step selection functions to relate movement decisions to canopy attributes.
   We found that movement decisions were correlated with canopy height and distance to gaps, which indicate forest maturity and lateral connectivity, in all three species. In the two faster-moving species, step selection was also correlated with the thickness of the crown layer and the density of vegetation within the crown.
   The correlations detected are fully in line with known differences in the locomotor adaptations and movement strategies of the study species, and directly reflect maximization of energetic efficiency and ability to escape from predators. Quantification of step selection in relation to structure thus provides insight into the ways in which arboreal animals use their environment.

TI Simply typed fixpoint calculus and collapsible pushdown automata
SO MATHEMATICAL STRUCTURES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Simply typed lambda-calculus with fixpoint combinators lambda Y -calculus, offers an interesting method for approximating program semantics. The Bohm tree of a lambda Y -term represents the meaning of the program up to the meaning of built-in constants. It is much easier to reason about properties of such trees than properties of interpreted programs. Moreover, some interesting properties of programs are already expressible on the level of these trees.
   Collapsible pushdown automata (CPDA) give another way of generating the same class of trees as lambda Y -terms. We clarify the relationship between the two models. In particular, we present two relatively simple translations from lambda Y terms to CPDA using Krivine machines as an intermediate step. The latter are general machines for describing computation of the weak head normal form in the lambda-calculus. They provide the notions of closure and environment that facilitate reasoning about computation.

TI Autoencoder-based identification of predictors of Indian monsoon
SO METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS
AB Prediction of Indian summer monsoon uses a number of climatic variables that are historically known to provide a high skill. However, relationships between predictors and predictand could be complex and also change with time. The present work attempts to use a machine learning technique to identify new predictors for forecasting the Indian monsoon. A neural network-based non-linear dimensionality reduction technique, namely, the sparse autoencoder is used for this purpose. It extracts a number of new predictors that have prediction skills higher than the existing ones. Two non-linear ensemble prediction models of regression tree and bagged decision tree are designed with identified monsoon predictors and are shown to be superior in terms of prediction accuracy. Proposed model shows mean absolute error of 4.5 % in predicting the Indian summer monsoon rainfall. Lastly, geographical distribution of the new monsoon predictors and their characteristics are discussed.

TI Spatiotemporal variability of the latest frosts in Korean Peninsula and
   causes of atmospheric circulation
SO METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS
AB The spatiotemporal distributions of latest frost dates (LFDs) on the Korean Peninsula and the atmospheric circulation patterns that resulted in the latest frosts (LFs) were investigated through the use of historical records and modern weather observation data. During the modern observation period since 1904, the most recent record of LF was April 28, 2013 at Daegwallyeong. On average, the LF occurred in Korea between March 17 (at Wando) and May 10 (at Daegwallyeong). Positive correlations were found between LFD and altitude and latitude. Additionally, inter- annual variation of LFD showed a trend of progressively earlier dates at 32 of the 48 stations at which data were available. The historic data set consists of the following: 39 records of frosts during the Three-States Period (57 BC-998 AD): 34 records during the Goryeo Dynasty (998-1391), among which the latest record was in July of the lunar calendar: and 498 during the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1928) with one LF dated August 31, 1417 on the solar calendar. Regarding LFD from The Annals of the Joseon Dynasty, April has 11 records, May has 55, June has 46, July has 21, and August has 5 LFD records. Various meteorological causes of the latest LF were then established. Firstly, a cold and humid north-easterly current that originates from high latitudes of more than 50A degrees N and passes through the East Sea is considered one of the dominant causes of LF. Secondly, strong radiative cooling under clear skies is suspected as another important cause. Thirdly, a specific pressure pattern, called the 'inverted-S contour' or 'North High and South Low (NHSL) pattern' was found to be a favorable condition for LF. Finally the latest LF was not found to be related to monthly or longer-term cold climate, but are instead linked to the abrupt development of a strong ridge over inland Asia and the unusual southward movement of the tall polar cyclone over the North Pacific Ocean.

TI Family-Joining: A Fast Distance-Based Method for Constructing Generally
   Labeled Trees
SO MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB The widely used model for evolutionary relationships is a bifurcating tree with all taxa/observations placed at the leaves. This is not appropriate if the taxa have been densely sampled across evolutionary time and may be in a direct ancestral relationship, or if there is not enough information to fully resolve all the branching points in the evolutionary tree. In this article, we present a fast distance-based agglomeration method called family-joining (FJ) for constructing so-called generally labeled trees in which taxa may be placed at internal vertices and the tree may contain polytomies. FJ constructs such trees on the basis of pairwise distances and a distance threshold. We tested three methods for threshold selection, FJ-AIC, FJ-BIC, and FJ-CV, which minimize Akaike information criterion, Bayesian information criterion, and cross-validation error, respectively. When compared with related methods on simulated data, FJ-BIC was among the best at reconstructing the correct tree across a wide range of simulation scenarios. FJ-BIC was applied to HIV sequences sampled from individuals involved in a known transmission chain. The FJ-BIC tree was found to be compatible with almost all transmission events. On average, internal branches in the FJ-BIC tree have higher bootstrap support than branches in the leaf-labeled bifurcating tree constructed using RAxML. 36% and 25% of the internal branches in the FJ-BIC tree and RAxML tree, respectively, have bootstrap support greater than 70%. To the best of our knowledge the method presented here is the first attempt at modeling evolutionary relationships using generally labeled trees.

TI Mapping Phylogenetic Trees to Reveal Distinct Patterns of Evolution
SO MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB Evolutionary relationships are frequently described by phylogenetic trees, but a central barrier in many fields is the difficulty of interpreting data containing conflicting phylogenetic signals. We present a metric-based method for comparing trees which extracts distinct alternative evolutionary relationships embedded in data. We demonstrate detection and resolution of phylogenetic uncertainty in a recent study of anole lizards, leading to alternate hypotheses about their evolutionary relationships. We use our approach to compare trees derived from different genes of Ebolavirus and find that the VP30 gene has a distinct phylogenetic signature composed of three alternatives that differ in the deep branching structure.

TI The rediscovery of malaria parasites of ungulates
SO PARASITOLOGY
AB Over a hundred years since their first description in 1913, the sparsely described malaria parasites (genus Plasmodium) of ungulates have been rediscovered using molecular typing techniques. In the span of weeks, three studies have appeared describing the genetic characterization and phylogenetic analyses of malaria parasites from African antelope (Cephalophus spp.) and goat (Capra aegagrus hircus), Asian water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis), and North American white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Here we unify the contributions from those studies with the literature on pre-molecular characterizations of ungulate malaria parasites, which are largely based on surveys of Giemsa-reagent stained blood smears. We present a phylogenetic tree generated from all available ungulate malaria parasite sequence data, and show that parasites from African duiker antelope and goat, Asian water buffalo and New World white-tailed deer group together in a clade, which branches early in Plasmodium evolution. Anopheline mosquitoes appear to be the dominant, if not sole vectors for parasite transmission. We pose questions for future phylogenetic studies, and discuss topics that we hope will spur further molecular and cellular studies of ungulate malaria parasites.

TI Spraying of Leaf-Colonizing Bacillus amyloliquefaciens Protects Pepper
   from Cucumber mosaic virus
SO PLANT DISEASE
AB Beneficial plant-associated bacteria protect host plants against pathogens, including viruses. However, leaf-associated (phyllosphere) bacteria have rarely been investigated as potential triggers of plant systemic defense against plant viruses. We found that leaf-colonizing Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain 5B6 (isolated from a cherry tree leaf) protected Nicotiana benthamiana and pepper plants against Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV).,a field trial, treatment with strain 5B6 significantly reduced the relative contents of CMV coat protein RNA compared with the water control over a 3-year period, as revealed by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. The expression of Capsicum annuum pathogenesis-related (PR) genes CaPR4, CaPR5, and CaPR10 was upregulated in field-grown pepper plants treated with strain 5B6. In addition, the accumulation of two naturally occurring viruses, Broad bean wilt virus and Pepper mottle virus, was reduced by foliar treatment with strain 5B6, which is similar to the results for benzothiadiazole treatment as a positive control. Taken together, the results suggest that strain 5B6 has strong potential for protecting plants against viruses by increasing defense priming of salicylic acid and jasmonic acid signaling in pepper under field conditions. This is the first report of the protection of a plant against viral diseases by foliar application of leaf associated bacilli.

This paper maintains that one such barrier is the perception that users of responsible brands are not worthy of social emulation. Consumers are less likely to adopt brands positioned explicitly on their positive environmental or social credentials because of the stereotypes attached to the users of these products. Two empirical studies demonstrate that users of responsible brands are perceived as stereotypically warm. Warmth, however, is not an appealing feature in a consumption context. Warm groups are not envied and envy plays a central role in fueling a desire to emulate a consumption group. The study is the first to examine the possibility that a group-level stereotype limits the potential attractiveness of responsible brands. The significant implications of this insight for both scholarly research and marketing practice are examined in detail. The presence of a warmth stereotype, which has a negative influence on the social perception of responsible brands, suggests that the development of niches of responsible or ethical consumers is intrinsically problematic.

TI Mining unexpected patterns using decision trees and interestingness
   measures: a case study of endometriosis
SO SOFT COMPUTING
AB Because clinical research is carried out in complex environments, prior domain knowledge, constraints, and expert knowledge can enhance the capabilities and performance of data mining. In this paper we propose an unexpected pattern mining model that uses decision trees to compare recovery rates of two different treatments, and to find patterns that contrast with the prior knowledge of domain users. In the proposed model we define interestingness measures to determine whether the patterns found are interesting to the domain. By applying the concept of domain-driven data mining, we repeatedly utilize decision trees and interestingness measures in a closed-loop, in-depth mining process to find unexpected and interesting patterns. We use retrospective data from transvaginal ultrasound-guided aspirations to show that the proposed model can successfully compare different treatments using a decision tree, which is a new usage of that tool. We believe that unexpected, interesting patterns may provide clinical researchers with different perspectives for future research.

TI Effects of self-pulsation on the spray characteristics of gas-liquid
   swirl coaxial injector
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
AB To understand the influence of self-pulsation on the spray characteristics of gas-liquid swirl coaxial injector, a back-lighting photography technique has been employed to capture the instantaneous self pulsated spray and stable spray images with a high speed camera. The diameter and velocity of the droplets in the spray have been characterized with a Dantec Phase Doppler Anemometry (PDA) system. The effects of self-pulsation on the spray pattern, primary breakup, spray angle, diameter and velocity distribution and mass flow rate distribution are analyzed and discussed. The results show that the spray morphology is greatly influenced by self-pulsation. The stable spray has a cone shape, while the self pulsated spray looks like a Christmas tree. The main difference of these two sprays is the primary breakup. The liquid film of stable spray keeps stable while that of self-pulsated spray oscillates periodically. The film width of self-pulsated spray varies in a large range with 'neck' and 'shoulder' features existing. The liquid film of self-pulsated spray breaks up at the second neck, and then the second shoulder begins to breakup into ligaments. The self-pulsated spray produces droplet clusters periodically, varies horizontal spray width and mass flux periodically. From the point of spatial distribution, self pulsation is good for the spray, it uniformizes the mass flux along radius and increases the spray angle. However, when self-pulsation occurs, the SMD distribution varies from an inverted V shape to a hollow cone shape, and SMD increases at all the measuring points. Namely, from the point of atomization performance, self-pulsation has negative effects even when the breakup length is smaller. The effects of self-pulsation on the diameter and velocity distributions of the spray are mainly in the center part of the spray. The periphery of stable and self-pulsated spray has similar diameter and velocity distribution. (C) 2016 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Primary arm array during directional solidification of a single-crystal
   binary alloy: Large-scale phase-field study
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Primary arm arrays formed during the directional solidification of a single-crystal binary alloy were investigated by performing large-scale phase-field simulations using the GPU supercomputer TSUBAME2.5 at Tokyo Institute of Technology. The primary arm array and spacing were investigated by Voronoi decomposition and Delaunay triangulation, respectively. It was concluded that a hexagonal array was dominant for both the dendrite and cell structures and that penta hepta defects, which are typical defects in hexagonal patterns, were formed. The primary arms continuously moved such that the number of hexagons increased, and the distribution of primary arm spacing became uniform over time even after the number of primary arms was constant. The order of array was highest in the growth condition of the dendrite close to the cell-to-dendrite transition region. In addition, we proposed a realistic and accurate evaluation method of primary arm array by removing small sides from the Voronoi polygons. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Cost effectiveness analysis of fesoterodine compared to mirabegron in
   first-line therapy setting for overactive bladder with urge urinary
   incontinence, from the Spanish National Health System perspective
SO ACTAS UROLOGICAS ESPANOLAS
AB Objectives: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of first-line treatment of Overactive Bladder (OAB) with fesoterodine relative to mirabegron, from the Spanish National Health System (NHS) perspective.
   Methods: A decision tree model was developed to represent a typical clinical process of 52-week of treatment for an OAB patient with urge urinary incontinence (UUI) initiating first-line therapy with fesoterodine 4 mg, including optional titration to 8 mg, vs.mirabegron 50 mg. Efficacy data were obtained from a Bayesian indirect treatment meta-analysis. Patients with UUI of less than one episode/day were defined as treatment responder and persistence was assessed at weeks 4, 12 and 24. At week 12, non-responders discontinued treatment permanently. Quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated based on time spent in responder and non-responder states. OAB-related drug and medical care costs including physician visits, laboratory tests, incontinence pads, and comorbidities (fracture, skin infection, urinary tract infections and depression) were modeled and expressed in (sic)2015.
   Results: At week 52, the percentage of responders was 20.8% for patients starting on fesoterodine 4 mg who optionally titrated to 8 mg and 19.4% for patients treated with mirabegron. QALYs were slightly higher with fesoterodine than mirabegron (0.7703vs. 0.7668, difference = 0.0035). Fesoterodine treatment also had slightly higher total costs than mirabegron (3,296(sic) vs. 3,217, difference= 79(sic)), resulting in a cost of 22,523/QALY(sic) gained for fesoterodine versus mirabegron. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis confirmed the slight advantage of fesoterodine with a 61.1% probability of being cost-effective at the 30,000(sic) willingness-to-pay for 1 QALY threshold.
   Conclusions: Given the relatively small 1-year cost difference between the two treatments, fesoterodine can be considered a cost-effective option relative to mirabegron for the first-line management of OAB with UUI in Spain. (C) 2016 AEU. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. All rights reserved.

TI Greening and producing: An economic assessment framework for integrating
   trees in cropping systems
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB Environmental measures in an agricultural context often lead to extra constraints in current farming. This suggests trade-offs between the environmental objectives and profitability. Whether trade-offs exist, or may be turned into win-win, depends on creative farm options to comply new constraints. This paper concentrates on Ecological Focus Areas as a new EU Common Agricultural Policy greening requirement, and investigates profitability changes of two greening options with permanent woody elements, hedgerows and alley cropping. We predicted discounted gross margins for a hedgerow and alley cropping greening option and four market scenarios on a representative arable farm in Flanders (Belgium). Starting from the tree row, over a distance of 1.64 times the tree height, relative crop yield is 70% as compared to a treeless situation. Between 1.64 and 9.52 times the tree height, relative yield is 107%. Beyond that point, the effect is considered negligible. Discounted gross margins are calculated to account for the time horizon. Relative discounted gross margins at farm level, compared to the business as usual option, vary between 91% and 108%, depending on market conditions and policy support. The calculations show that fulfilment of the 5% ecological focus area greening requirement on arable farms with hedgerows and alley cropping only becomes economically competitive to the traditional cropping systems with extra financial stimuli (e.g. greening payments). We also show and discuss how the calculations can be fine-tuned and used in policy making, e.g. by i) getting better insights in the tree-crop interactions, ii) including the effect of e.g. crop type, tree species, tree line space and tree line orientation in the meta-information, iii) evaluating this conditional competitiveness and suggesting a better linking between subsidy level and ecological value and ecosystem services and iv) exploring novel valorization channels for wood products.

TI Environmental efficiency of olive oil production by small and
   micro-scale farmers in northern Jordan: Life cycle assessment
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB Olive groves cover nearly 73% of the total tree-planted agricultural land in Jordan, making olive oil production one of the most important agri-business sectors in the country. Nearly half of the olive trees are planted in the northern region of Jordan where the sector is dominated by small and micro-scale farming practices, Olive farmers rely on traditional production methods with little mechanization or chemicals use. To better understand the environmental impact of the industry on the environment and to compare it to other olive oil production practices in the Mediterranean region; life cycle assessment study was carried out. Five environmental impact categories relevant in the context of Jordan were assessed: acidification (AP); particulate matter formation (PM10); human toxicity (HTP); climate change (GWP(100)) and agricultural land occupation (AGLO). The study revealed that olive oil production in the northern region of Jordan is environmentally efficient when compared to large scale production practices common in other Mediterranean olive oil producing countries. On average, the production of 1 kg of olive oil in northern Jordan contributed: 0.57 kg CO2eq to GWP(100); 11.8 x 10(-3) kg SO2eq to AP; 5.99 x 10(-3) kg PM10eq; 0.77 kg 1,4-DBeq to HTP and 22.54 m(2)*a to AGLO. Uncertainty due to variation at farm level practices affected all impact categories. Monte Carlo analysis showed that GWP(100) was the most sensitive to variation at farm level practices while HTP was the least sensitive. Nevertheless, despite the high level of uncertainty, Monte Carlo analysis suggested that the GWP100 was <1.55 kg CO2eq, 95% of the time. The efficiency of the Jordanian small and micro-olive oil production sector is due to its low level of water, energy and chemical usage in the agriculture phase and the efficient use of waste material for energy production to displace fossil fuel. Soil management practices are the major contributor of the environmental impacts. The system may be further improved if farmers adopt low tillage or no-tillage practices. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Stable Isotopic Variation in Tropical Forest Plants for Applications in
   Primatology
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY
AB Stable isotope analysis is a promising tool for investigating primate ecology although nuanced ecological applications remain challenging, in part due to the complex nature of isotopic variability in plant-animal systems. The aim of this study is to investigate sources of carbon and nitrogen isotopic variation at the base of primate food webs that reflect aspects of primate ecology. The majority of primates inhabit tropical forest ecosystems, which are dominated by C-3 vegetation. We used stable isotope ratios in plants from Kibale National Park, Uganda, a well-studied closed-canopy tropical forest, to investigate sources of isotopic variation among C-3 plants related to canopy stratification, leaf age, and plant part. Unpredictably, our results demonstrate that vertical stratification within the canopy does not explain carbon or nitrogen isotopic variation in leaves. Leaf age can be a significant source of isotopic variation, although the direction and magnitude of this difference is not consistent across tree species. Some plant parts are clearly differentiated in carbon and nitrogen isotopic composition, particularly leaves compared to non-photosynthetic parts such as reproductive parts and woody stem parts. Overall, variation in the isotopic composition of floral communities, plant species, and plant parts demonstrates that stable isotope studies must include analysis of local plant species and parts consumed by the primates under study from within the study area.

TI The Evolutionary Legacy of Diversification Predicts Ecosystem Function
SO AMERICAN NATURALIST
AB Theory suggests that the structure of evolutionary history represented in a species community may affect its functioning, but phylogenetic diversity metrics do not allow for the identification of major differences in this structure. Here we propose a new metric, ELDERness (for Evolutionary Legacy of DivERsity) to estimate evolutionary branching patterns within communities by fitting a polynomial function to lineage-through-time (LTT) plots. We illustrate how real and simulated community branching patterns can be more correctly described by ELDERness and can successfully predict ecosystem functioning. In particular, the evolutionary history of branching patterns can be encapsulated by the parameters of third-order polynomial functions and further measured through only two parameters, the "ELDERness surfaces." These parameters captured variation in productivity of a grassland community better than existing phylogenetic diversity or diversification metrics and independent of species richness or presence of nitrogen fixers. Specifically, communities with small ELDERness surfaces (constant accumulation of lineages through time in LTT plots) were more productive, consistent with increased productivity resulting from complementary lineages combined with niche filling within lineages. Overall, while existing phylogenetic diversity metrics remain useful in many contexts, we suggest that our ELDERness approach better enables testing hypotheses that relate complex patterns of macroevolutionary history represented in local communities to ecosystem functioning.

TI Identification of triacylglycerol using automated annotation of high
   resolution multistage mass spectral trees
SO ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA
AB High complexity of identification for non-target triacylglycerols (TAGs) is a major challenge in lipidomics analysis. To identify non-target TAGs, a powerful tool named accurate MSn spectrometry generating so-called ion trees is used. In this paper, we presented a technique for efficient structural elucidation of TAGs on MSn spectral trees produced by LTQ Orbitrap MSn, which was implemented as an open source software package, or TIT. The TIT software was used to support automatic annotation of non-target TAGs on MSn ion trees from a self-built fragment ion database. This database includes 19108 simulate TAG molecules from a random combination of fatty acids and corresponding 500582 self-built multistage fragment ions (MS <= 3). Our software can identify TAGs using a "stage-by-stage elimination" strategy. By utilizing the MS1 accurate mass and referenced RKMD, the TIT software can discriminate unique elemental composition candidates. The regiospecific isomers of fatty acyl chains will be distinguished using MS2 and MS3 fragment spectra. We applied the algorithm to the selection of 45 TAG standards and demonstrated that the molecular ions could be 100% correctly assigned. Therefore, the TIT software could be applied to TAG identification in complex biological samples such as mouse plasma extracts. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO ANTONIE VAN LEEUWENHOEK INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENERAL AND MOLECULAR
   MICROBIOLOGY
AB Isolated ecosystems existing under specific environmental conditions have been shown to be promising sources of new strains of actinobacteria. The taiga forest of Baikal Siberia has not been well studied, and its actinobacterial population remains uncharacterized. The proximity between the huge water mass of Lake Baikal and high mountain ranges influences the structure and diversity of the plant world in Siberia. Here, we report the isolation of eighteen actinobacterial strains from male cones of Scots pine trees (Pinus sylvestris) growing on the shore of the ancient Lake Baikal in Siberia. In addition to more common representative strains of Streptomyces, several species belonging to the genera Rhodococcus, Amycolatopsis, and Micromonospora were isolated. All isolated strains exhibited antibacterial and antifungal activities. We identified several strains that inhibited the growth of the pathogen Candida albicans but did not hinder the growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Several isolates were active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The high proportion of biologically active strains producing antibacterial and specific antifungal compounds may reflect their role in protecting pollen against phytopathogens.

TI Lysinibacillus endophyticus sp nov., an indole-3-acetic acid producing
   endophytic bacterium isolated from corn root (Zea mays cv. Xinken-5)
SO ANTONIE VAN LEEUWENHOEK INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENERAL AND MOLECULAR
   MICROBIOLOGY
AB A Gram-positive, aerobic, motile, rod-shaped bacterium, designated strain C9(T), was isolated from surface sterilised corn roots (Zea mays cv. Xinken-5) and found to be able to produce indole-3-acetic acid. A polyphasic taxonomic study was carried out to determine the status of strain C9(T). The major cellular fatty acids were found to contain iso-C-15:0, anteiso-C-15:0 and anteiso-C-17:0, and the only menaquinone was identified as MK-7. The polar lipid profile was found to contain diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, two unidentified phospholipids and an unidentified lipid. The cell wall peptidoglycan was found to be of the A4 alpha L-Lys-D-Asp type and the whole cell sugar was found to be glucose. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that strain C9(T) belongs to the genus Lysinibacillus and is closely related to Lysinibacillus chungkukjangi NBRC 108948(T) (98.1 % similarity) and Lysinibacillus sinduriensis DSM 27595(T) (98.0 %). However, the low levels of DNA-DNA relatedness and some differential phenotypic characteristics allowed the strain to be distinguished from its close relatives. Therefore, it is concluded that strain C9(T) represents a novel species of the genus Lysinibacillus, for which the name Lysinibacillus endophyticus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is C9(T) (=DSM 100506(T) = CGMCC 1.15291(T)).

   MICROBIOLOGY
AB The taxonomic relationship between Halomonas sinaiensis DSM 18067(T) and Halomonas caseinilytica JCM 14802(T) has not been established, despite the high similarity (99.6 %) of their 16S rRNA gene sequences. To clarify their taxonomic positions, a polyphasic approach was applied to both type strains. Genomic relatedness analyses between H. sinaiensis DSM 18067(T) and H. caseinilytica JCM 14802(T) resulted in an average nucleotide identity of 99.5 % and an estimated DNA-DNA hybridization of 96.1 % by the genome-to-genome distance calculator, indicating that they belong to a single species. Phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics showed no pronounced differences between the two type strains. Based on the results of this polyphasic study, it is proposed that H. caseinilytica JCM 14802(T) is a later heterotypic synonym of H. sinaiensis DSM 18067(T). An emended description for the species H. sinaiensis is given.

Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences demonstrated that strain XZ17(T) belongs to the genus Nocardioides in the family Nocardioidaceae. Strain XZ17(T) shared pairwise 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities of 97.2, 96.8, 96.5, 96.4 and < 96.0 % to Nocardioides solisilvae KCTC 39528(T), Nocardioides daejeonensis JCM 16922(T), Nocardioides jensenii NCIB 9770(T), Nocardioides dubius KCTC 9992(T) and other Nocardioides species, respectively. It contained MK-8 (H-4) as the predominant menaquinone and C-17:1 omega 8c, C-15:0, C-17:0 and C-18:1 omega 9c as the major fatty acid. The strain had cell wall peptidoglycan based on ll-2,6-diaminopimelic acid. The polar lipids of strain XZ17(T) comprised diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, three unidentified phospholipids, three unidentified glycolipids and two unidentified lipids. The DNA G+C content of strain XZ17(T) was 68.9 mol%. Based on distinctive phenotypic characteristics, phylogenetic analysis and chemotaxonomic data, it can be concluded that strain XZ17(T) represents a novel species within the genus Nocardioides, for which the name Nocardioides gilvus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is strain XZ17(T) (=KCTC 39561(T) = MCCC 1H00114(T)).

TI Development of an integrated energy benchmark for a multi-family housing
   complex using district heating
SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB The reliable benchmarks are required to evaluate building energy efficiency fairly. This study aims to develop the energy benchmarks and relevant process for a multi-family housing complex (MFHC), which is responsible for huge CO2 emissions in South Korea. A database, including the information on building attributes and energy consumption of 503 MFHCs, was established. The database was classified into three groups based on average enclosed area per household (AEA) through data mining techniques. The benchmarks of site energy use intensity (EUI), source EUI, and CO2 emission intensity (CEI) were developed from Groups 1, 2, and 3. Representatively, the developed benchmarks of CEI for Groups 1, 2, and 3 were 28.17, 24.16, and 20.96 kg-CO2/m(2) y, respectively. A comparative analysis using the operational rating identified that the developed benchmarks could solve the irrationality of the original benchmarks from overall database. In the case of the original benchmarks, 93% of small-AEA-groups and 16% of large AEA-groups received lower grades. In the case of the developed benchmark, the upper and lower grades in Groups 1-3 were both adjusted to 50%. The proposed process for developing energy benchmark is applicable to evaluate the energy efficiency of other buildings, in other regions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Biochar derived from orchid tree leaves is utilised as the fuel of a direct carbon solid oxide fuel cell (DC-SOFC), with yttrium stabilized zirconia (YSZ) as electrolyte and cermet of silver and gadolinium doped ceria (Ag-GDC) as the material of both cathode and anode, operating without any liquid medium or feeding gas. The performance of the DC-SOFC operated on the leaf char is higher than that operated on the best reported carbon fuel for DC-SOFCs, Fe-loaded activated carbon. XRD, Raman spectroscopy, SEM and EDX are applied to characterize the leaf char. It turns out that the leaf char is with porous structure and there is much Ca along with some K and Mg uniformly distributing in the leaf char. The effects of the naturally existing alkaline earth metal and alkaline metal and their distribution on the performance of the DC-SOFCs operated on the leaf char are analyzed in detail.

TI Lead fluxes and Pb-206/Pb-207 isotope ratios in rime and snow collected
   at remote mountain-top locations (Czech Republic, Central Europe):
   Patterns and sources
SO ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
AB During three winter seasons (2009-2011), Pb concentrations were measured in precipitation at 10 high elevation sites in the Czech Republic, close to the borders with Austria, Germany, Poland, and Slovakia. Soluble and insoluble Pb forms were quantified in snow (vertical deposition), and rime (horizontal deposition). The objective was to compare Pb input fluxes into ecosystems via vertical and horizontal deposition, and to identify the residual Pb pollution sources in an era of rapidly decreasing industrial pollution. Lead soluble in diluted HNO3 made up 96% of total Pb deposition, with the remaining 4% Pb bound mainly in silicates. Three times higher concentrations of soluble Pb in rime than in snow, and 2.5 times higher concentrations of insoluble Pb in rime than in snow were associated with slightly different Pb isotope ratios. On average, the Pb-206/Pb-207 ratios in rime were higher than those in snow. Higher mean Pb-206/Pb-207 ratios of insoluble Pb (1.175) than in soluble Pb (1.165) may indicate an increasing role of geogenic Pb in recent atmospheric deposition. A distinct reversal to more radiogenic Pb-206/Pb-207 ratios in snow and rime in 2010, compared to literature data from rain-fed Sphagnum peatlands (1800-2000 A.D.), documented a recent decrease in anthropogenic Pb in the atmosphere of Central Europe. Since the early 1980s, Pb concentrations in snow decreased 18 times in the rural south of the Czech Republic, but only twice in the industrial north of the Czech Republic. Isotope signatures indicated that Pb in today's atmospheric deposition is mainly derived from Mesozoic ores mined/processed in Poland and coal combustion in the Czech Republic and Poland.

TI Molecular Evaluation of Genetic Diversity in Wild-Type Mastic Tree
   (Pistacia lentiscus L.)
SO BIOCHEMICAL GENETICS
AB In this study, the patterns of genetic variation and phylogenetic relationships of mastic tree (Pistacia lentiscus L.) genotypes including 12 males and 12 females were evaluated using SSR, RAPD, ISSR, and ITS markers yielding 40, 703, 929 alleles, and 260-292 base pairs for ITS1 region, respectively. The average number of alleles produced from SSR, RAPD, and ISSR primers were 5.7, 14, and 18, respectively. The grouping pattern obtained from Bayesian clustering method based on each marker dataset was produced. Principal component analyses (PCA) of molecular data was investigated and neighbor joining dendrograms were subsequently created. Overall, the results indicated that ISSR and RAPD markers were the most powerful to differentiate the genotypes in comparison with other types of molecular markers used in this study. The ISSR results indicated that male and female genotypes were distinctly separated from each other. In this frame, M9 (Ala double dagger atA+/-) and M10 (Mesta SakA+/-z AdasA+/--Chios) were the closest genotypes and while F11 (Seferihisar) and F12 (Bornova/Gokdere) genotypes fall into same cluster and showing closer genetic relation. The RAPD pattern indicated that M8 (Urla) and M10 (Mesta SakA+/-z AdasA+/--Chios), and F10 (Mesta SakA+/-z AdasA+/--Chios) and F11 (Seferihisar) genotypes were the closest male and female genotypes, respectively.

TI Formal analysis of the surgical pathway and development of a new
   software tool to assist surgeons in the decision making in primary
   breast surgery
SO BREAST
AB Background: The increased complexity of the decisional process in breast cancer surgery is well documented. With this study we aimed to create a software tool able to assist patients and surgeons in taking proper decisions.
   Methodology: We hypothesized that the endpoints of breast cancer surgery could be addressed combining a set of decisional drivers. We created a decision support system software tool (DSS) and an interactive decision tree. A formal analysis estimated the information gain derived from each feature in the process. We tested the DSS on 52 patients and we analyzed the concordance of decisions obtained by different users and between the DSS suggestions and the actual surgery. We also tested the ability of the system to prevent post breast conservation deformities.
   Results: The information gain revealed that patients preferences are the root of our decision tree. An observed concordance respectively of 0.98 and 0.88 was reported when the DSS was used twice by an expert operator or by a newly trained operator vs. an expert one. The observed concordance between the DSS suggestion and the actual decision was 0.69. A significantly higher incidence of post breast conservation defects was reported among patients who did not follow the DSS decision (Type III of Fitoussi, N = 4; 333%, p = 0.004).
   Conclusion: The DSS decisions can be reproduced by operators with different experience. The concordance between suggestions and actual decision is quite low, however the DSS is able to prevent post breast conservation deformities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Preoperative prediction of histopathological outcome in basal cell
   carcinoma: flat surface and multiple small erosions predict superficial
   basal cell carcinoma in lighter skin types
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
AB Background Prediction of the histopathological subtype of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is important for tailoring optimal treatment, especially in patients with suspected superficial BCC (sBCC).
   Objectives To assess the accuracy of the preoperative prediction of subtypes of BCC in clinical practice, to evaluate whether dermoscopic examination enhances accuracy and to find dermoscopic criteria for discriminating sBCC from other subtypes.
   Materials and methods The main presurgical diagnosis was compared with the histopathological, postoperative diagnosis of routinely excised skin tumours in a predominantly fair skinned patient cohort of northern Europe during a study period of 3 years (2011-13). The study period was split in two: during period I, dermoscopy was optional (850 cases with a pre- or postoperative diagnosis of BCC), while during period 2 (after an educational dermoscopic update) dermoscopy was mandatory (651 cases). A classification tree based on clinical and dermoscopic features for prediction of sBCC was applied.
   Results For a total of 3 544 excised skin tumours, the sensitivity for the diagnosis of BCC (any subtype) was 93.3, specificity 91.8%, and the positive predictive value (PPV) 89.0%. The diagnostic accuracy as well as the PPV and the positive likelihood ratio for sBCC were significantly higher when dermoscopy was mandatory. A fiat surface and multiple small erosions predicted sBCC.
   Conclusions The study shows a high accuracy for an overall diagnosis of BCC and increased accuracy in prediction of sBCC for the period when dermoscopy was applied in all cases. The most discriminating findings for sBCC, based on clinical and dermoscopic features in this fair-skinned population, were a flat surface and multiple small erosions.

TI Development of an occupancy prediction model using indoor environmental
   data based on machine learning techniques
SO BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
AB Occupant presence and behavior in buildings have significant impact on space heating, cooling and ventilation demand, energy consumption of lighting and appliances, and building controls. For this reason, there is a growing interest on modeling occupant behavior, especially occupancy information. An occupancy prediction model based on an indirect approach using indoor environmental data is important due to privacy concerns and inaccurate measurements associated with the direct approach using cameras and motion sensors. However, such an indirect-approach-based occupancy prediction model has not yet fully discussed in building simulation domain. To tackle these issues, this study aims to develop an indoor environmental data-driven model for occupancy prediction using machine learning techniques.
   The experiments in the Building Integrated Control Test-bed (BICT) at Dankook University was conducted to collect the ground truth occupancy profiles, indoor and outdoor CO2 concentrations and electricity consumptions of lighting systems and appliances for a data mining study. The results show that the proposed indoor environmental data-driven models for occupancy prediction using the decision tree and hidden Markov model (HMM) algorithms are well suited to account for occupancy detection at the current state and occupancy prediction at the future state, respectively.

AB Mixed-species stands are on the advance in Europe. They fulfil many functions better than monocultures. Recent papers show that mixed stands can have higher yields, but it remains open whether mixed stands simply grow faster along the same self-thinning lines as pure stands or have higher maximum stand densities. We analyzed the effect of species mixing on maximum density based on triplets of pure and mixed stands at approximately maximum density. Most considered mixtures include Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.). We show that (i) in mixed stands, maximum density is, on average, 16.5% higher than in neighbouring pure stands, and (ii) species mixtures with Norway spruce exceed densities of pure stands by 8.8%, on average. For individual species mixtures, we find a significant density effect of +29.1% for Norway spruce mixed with European larch (Larix decidua Mill.) and +35.9% for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in association with European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.). No significant links with stand variables such as age and mean tree size and site fertility were found. The results indicate that species mixing substantially increases stand density, indicating a higher carrying capacity caused by a higher supply and use efficiency of resources. The implications for inventory, silviculture, and forest modelling are discussed.

AB Widespread application of the selection system will depend on whether creating stands with uneven-sized (UES) structures comes at the expense of net periodic annual basal area increment (PAI) compared with stands with even-sized (ES) structures. I modeled PAI on growing stock and structural complexity over 12 years in midrotation stands with ES and UES structure types. Average PAI of the largest trees did not differ among types and decreased with increasing stocking, whereas PAI of the smallest trees in the UES type declined with stocking. Trees >= 10 cm in diameter grew more slowly in the ES type than the UES type, but no difference was seen after incorporating small trees (down to 5 or 2 cm). In the ES type, PAI of most trees increased linearly with increasing stocking, whereas in the UES type, it increased only up to similar to 20 m(2).ha(-1). As structural complexity increased, PAI of the largest trees increased in the ES type, whereas PAI of all but the largest trees decreased in the UES type. Neither silvicultural system was innately more productive, as each can outperform the other under optimal levels of stocking and structural complexity. However, optimizing increment of only large trees would undermine the UES type.

AB Mixed-species stands present a number of opportunities for and challenges to forest managers. Boreal mixedwood stands in eastern Canada are often characterized by a dominant canopy of shade-intolerant aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) with more shade-tolerant conifers in the mid-to sub-canopy layers. Because the aspen and conifer components often attain optimal merchantable sizes at different moments in stand development, there is an interest in developing silvicultural practices that allow partial or total removal of aspen and favour accelerated growth of residual conifers. We tested four partial harvesting treatments in mixed aspen - white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench.) Voss) stands in which different proportions of aspen (0%, 50%, 65%, and 100% basal area) were removed. Ten years after treatments, 72 spruce stems representing dominant, co-dominant, and suppressed social classes were destructively sampled for stem analysis. Using linear mixed effect models, we analyzed growth as a function of treatment intensity, time since treatment, social status, pretreatment growth rate, and neighbourhood competition. Relative to control stands, radial and volume growth responses were detected only in the extreme treatment of 100% aspen removal. In relative terms, suppressed trees showed the greatest magnitude of cumulative growth increase. Compared with control trees, average annual radial and volume increments were, respectively, 23.5% and 7.1% higher for dominant trees, 67.7% and 24.1% higher for co-dominant trees, and 115.8% and 65.6% higher for suppressed trees over the 10 years after treatment. Growth response was proportional to pretreatment growth rate, and among neighbouring trees, only coniferous neighbours had a negative effect on white spruce growth. Our results suggest that in similar mixed-stand conditions, relatively heavy removal of overstory aspen accompanied by thinning of crowded conifers would result in greatest growth response of residual spruce stems.

AB Carbon isotope ratio (delta C-13) has been used as an indicator of water stress because plants discriminate less against C-13 when under stress. The depth-to-water (DTW) topographic index provides an estimation of soil moisture based on topographic position and other characteristics of a site. To evaluate whether DTW and carbon isotope discrimination were related and to determine if these relationships are influenced by climate, we sampled three time periods, which differed in the amount of annual precipitation (MAP), from tree cores collected from 42 trembling aspen and 43 white spruce trees growing along DTW gradients at two locations in central Alberta, Canada. Increasing MAP led to lower delta C-13, indicating less drought stress as water availability increases, while delta C-13 increased with DTW up to a threshold value, after which the relationship levelled off, suggesting that higher DTW values represent stress-inducing soil conditions. DTW and MAP were then combined into models (aspen, R-2 = 0.72; spruce, R-2 = 0.44) that could be used to delineate drought-prone areas during periods of low MAP. Tree height and diameter were also related to DTW, suggesting a functional relationship between an index capturing soil properties and tree size. Our results demonstrate the potential to use the DTW index as a measure of site conditions and to predict stand-level responses.

AB We examined modulus of elasticity (MoE) derived from SilviScan in white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) at the site, tree, and ring levels across the Boreal Plains ecozone in Canada. Area-weighted averages of MoE were calculated for juvenile and mature wood and were examined in relation to radial growth, climate, and location. Correlations indicated that there was a negative relationship between radial growth and MoE in the juvenile wood that was detectable at the site and tree levels; however, the relationship weakened in the mature wood, particularly at the site level. Few climate variables were correlated with MoE in juvenile wood, whereas multiple summer and fall climate variables showed a significant correlation with MOE in mature wood. A model describing the radial profile of MoE explained 58% of the variability in MoE, with 10% of the random variability attributed to between-tree differences. Elevation and summer water balance accounted for nearly all of the between-site variability. A decrease in MoE with increasing elevation was noted and has been previously linked to a decrease in cell wall thickness due to a shorter growing season at higher elevations. Integration of the MoE profile model into an individual-tree growth and yield simulator is the next logical step.

TI Selection of mango rosa genotypes in a breeding population using the
   multivariate-biplot method
SO CIENCIA RURAL
AB Mango (Mangifera indica L.) trees stand out among the main fruit trees cultivated in Brazil. The mango rosa fruit is a very popular local variety (landrace), especially because of their superior technological characteristics such as high contents of Vitamin C and soluble solids (SS), as well as attractive taste and color. The objective of this study was to select a breeding population of mango rosa (polyclonal variety; >= 5 individuals) that can simultaneously meet the fresh and processed fruit markets, using the multivariate method of principal components and the biplot graphic. The principal components, biplot graphic, and phenotype correlations were obtained using the R (2012) software. Pulp percentage and the pulp, skin, and seed mass variables can be indirectly selected using the smallest fruit diameter, which allowed an easier measurement. The P23R AREA3, P30R AREA3, and P32R AREA3 genotypes are selection candidates due to the presence of alleles, which are important agro-technological traits for mango breeding. This study showed that the biplot analysis is a valuable tool for decision making and visualization of interrelationships between variables and genotypes, facilitating the mango selection process.

TI Yield efficiency for nine apple cultivars grafted on two rootstocks
SO CIENCIA RURAL
AB Currently, using smaller trees is one of the most important trends in apple cultivation. It is expected that reduced size plants produce lower amount of fruit, but with high yield and yield efficiency. The aim of this study was to evaluate the yield efficiency (YE) of nine apple tree cultivars, grafted on two rootstocks, from the second to the seventh year after planting. The YE indexes oscillated from one to the other year, regardless of rootstock. Correlations between YE and yield per tree and between YE and trunk cross sectional area (TCSA) confirmed that efficiency can be increased by the production increment or by the plant's vigor reduction. The usefulness of cumulative YE (Sigma YE) is highlighted to compare apple tree cultivars after the third year of production. The highest Sigma YE indexes were observed for 'Royal Gala' and 'Baigent', on M-9 rootstock, and for 'Gala Real' and 'Maxi-Gala', on Marubakaido/M-9 rootstock.

TI Blackberry and redberry production in crop and intercrop in Pouso
   Alegre, southern Minas Gerais, Brazil
SO CIENCIA RURAL
AB The cultivation of mulberry (Rubus sp.) is highly disseminated in cold climates, but some cultivars adapt to warm weather environments. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the production of blackberry and redberry in season and off season in Pouso Alegre, south of Minas Gerais. The experimental design was a randomized block, with twelve cultivars ('Arapaho', 'Xavante', 'Brazos', 'Tupy' 'Comanche', 'Choctaw', 'Guarani', 'Caingangue', 'Cherokee', 'Chicasaw' and 'Clone' and a redberry, three blocks and an experimental unit of four plants with a spacing of 0.5x3.0m and a total density of 6,666 plants per hectare. Conventional pruning was performed to produce the crop (October-December) and for off-season production (April-July). In 'Brazos' there was increased production in the two seasons evaluated against other mulberry trees, conversely, in the off season, there was a positive effect of pruning carried out in January only in 'Tupy', 'Choctaw', 'Comanche' and 'Clone', with 'Tupy' presenting the highest productivity off season. In 'Brazos' and 'Tupy' there was the best balance between soluble solids and acidity in the crop and red berry in season. 'Brazos' and 'Cherokee' had the highest average content of total sugars. Due to the lack of supply of fruit, pruning mulberry trees in January is an alternative to increase the income of family-based farms.

TI Event-based exponential synchronization of complex networks
SO COGNITIVE NEURODYNAMICS
AB In this paper, we consider exponential synchronization of complex networks. The information diffusions between nodes are driven by properly defined events. By employing the M-matrix theory, algebraic graph theory and the Lyapunov method, two kinds of distributed event-triggering laws are designed, which avoid continuous communications between nodes. Then, several criteria that ensure the event-based exponential synchronization are presented, and the exponential convergence rates are obtained as well. Furthermore, we prove that Zeno behavior of the event-triggering laws can be excluded before synchronization being achieved, that is, the lower bounds of inter-event times are strictly positive. Finally, a simulation example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of theoretical analysis.

TI Solute carriers (SLCs) identified and characterized from kidney
   transcriptome of golden mahseer (Tor putitora) (Fam: Cyprinidae)
SO COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMISTRY & MOLECULAR
   BIOLOGY
AB The solute carriers (SLC) are trans-membrane proteins, those regulate the transport of various substances (sugars, amino acids, nucleotides, inorganic cations/anions, metals, drugs etc.) across the cell membrane. There are more than 338 solute carriers (slc) reported in fishes that play crucial role in cellular influx and efflux. The study of solute carrier families may reveal many answers regarding the function of transporter genes in the species and their effect in the existing environment. Therefore, we performed RNA sequencing of kidney tissue of the golden mahseer (Tor putitora) using Illumina platform to identify the solute carrier families and characterized 24 putative functional genes under 15 solute carrier families. Out of 24 putative functional genes, 11 genes were differentially expressed in different tissues (head kidney, trunk kidney, spleen, liver, gill, muscle, intestine and brain) using qRT-PCR assay. The slc5a1, slc5a12, slc12a3, slc13a3, slc22a13 and slc26a6 were highly expressed in kidney. The slc15a2, slc25a47, slc33a1 and slc38a2 were highly expressed in brain and slc30a5 was over-expressed in gill. The unrooted phylogenetic trees of slc2, slc5, slc13 and slc33 were constructed using amino acid sequences of Homo sapiens, Salmo salar, Danio rerio, Cyprinus carpio and Tor putitora. It appears that all the putative solute carrier families are very much conserved in human and fish species including the present fish, golden mahseer. This study provides the first hand database of solute carrier families particularly transporter encoding proteins in the species. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Ground-penetrating radar for Observing tree trunks and other cylindrical
   objects
SO CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS
AB To improve forest management and to prevent collapses of trees, it is necessary to investigate the internal part of tree trunks. In order to do it non-invasively, ground-penetrating radar (GPR) appears as a promising inspection device. The objective of this paper is to investigate particularities of tree trunks radar images, considering the circumferential data acquisition geometry, as a function of the radar configuration and trunk section structures. In order to better understand this kind of data, a target reflection curve was analytically described, then, the total internal reflection (TIR) phenomenon was explained and illustrated. Subsequently, classical radar measurements were compared with an application of differently shaped (planar and circular) metal shields acting as perfect electrical conductors (PEC). For comparing the methods, three experiments were performed: (1) numerical simulations using the software gprMax2D, based on Finite-Difference Time-Domain method, (2) GPR investigation of a laboratory model of a tree trunk, (3) real tree trunk measurements. The use of a planar or circular PEC increased the visibility of the medium edges, so, these GPR images were considered of a better quality. Internal object reflection curve and TIR detection were essential for general description of a GPR image. All experiments showed satisfactorily the internal inhomogeneity and the information will be useful for future tomographic reconstruction. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Estimating occupancy in heterogeneous sensor environment
SO ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB A general approach is proposed to determine the common sensors that shall be used to estimate and classify the approximate number of people (within a range) in a room. The range is dynamic and depends on the maximum occupancy met in a training data set for instance. Means to estimate occupancy include motion detection, power consumption, CO2 concentration sensors, microphone or door/window positions. The proposed approach is inspired by machine learning. It starts by determining the most useful measurements in calculating information gains. Then, estimation algorithms are proposed: they rely on decision tree learning algorithms because these yield decision rules readable by humans, which cot.: respond to nested if-then-else rules, where thresholds can be adjusted depending on the living areas considered. In addition, the decision tree depth is limited in order to simplify the analysis of the tree rules. Finally, an economic analysis is carried out to evaluate the cost and the most relevant sensor sets, with cost and accuracy comparison for the estimation of occupancy. C45 and random forest algorithms have been applied to an office setting, with average estimation error of 0.19-0.18. Over-fitting issues and best sensor sets are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI Technoeconomic assessment of beetle kill biomass co-firing in existing
   coal fired power plants in the Western United States
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB Widespread mortality of forests in the western United States due to a bark beetle epidemic provides a source of biomass for power generation. This study assessed availability and economics of co-firing beetle kill biomass with coal in power plants in the western U.S. Since biomass may be considered carbon neutral under careful management, co-combustion of biomass with coal provides power plants a way to meet emission reduction requirements, such as those in the EPA Clean Power Plan (CPP). Cost has been a barrier to co-firing, but the economics are altered by emission reduction requirements, such as CPP guidelines. The present study assessed beetle kill biomass availability in national forests in Wyoming and Colorado through Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis of U.S. Forest Service (USFS) data. Power plants near beetle kill mortality were identified as candidates for co-firing. An economic assessment of costs to implement co-firing was conducted. Co-firing reduces the need for the USFS to manage beetle kill trees when they are harvested for energy use, and these mitigated treatment costs were considered as an effective subsidy of co-firing. The results of this analysis include beetle kill availability, costs, and annual CO2 emissions reductions that can be met by co-firing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Understanding effects of cognitive rehabilitation under a knowledge
   discovery approach
SO ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and disability in children and young adults worldwide. Cognitive rehabilitation (CR) plans consist of a sequence of CR tasks targeting main cognitive functions. There is not enough on-field experience yet regarding which specific intervention (tasks or exercise assignment) is more appropriate to help therapists to design plans with significant effectiveness on patient improvement. The selection of specific tasks to be prescribed to the patient and the order in which they might be executed is currently decided by the therapists based on their experience.
   In this paper a new data mining methodology is proposed, combining several tools from Artificial Intelligence, clustering and post-processing analysis to identify regularities in the sequences of tasks in such a way that treatment profiles (classes) can be discovered. Due to the cumulative effect of rehabilitation tasks, small variations within the sequence of tasks performed by the patient do not significantly change the final outcomes in rehabilitation and makes it difficult to find discriminant rules by using the traditional machine learning inductive methods. However, by relaxing the formalization of the problem to find patterns that might include small variations, and introducing motif discovery techniques in the proposed methodology, the complexity of the neurorehabilitation phenomenon can be better captured and a global structure of successful treatment task sequences can be devised.
   Following this, the relationship between the discovered patterns and the CR treatment response are analyzed, offering a richer perspective than that provided by the single task focus traditionally used in the CR field.
   The paper provides a definition of the whole methodological approach proposed from a formal point of view, and its application to a real dataset. Comparisons with traditional AI approaches are also presented and the contribution of the proposed methodology to the Al field discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Fast algorithms for hiding sensitive high-utility itemsets in
   privacy-preserving utility mining
SO ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB High-Utility Itemset Mining (HUIM) is an extension of frequent itemset mining, which discovers itemsets yielding a high profit in transaction databases (Wits). In recent years, a major issue that has arisen is that data publicly published or shared by organizations may lead to privacy threats since sensitive or confidential information may be uncovered by data mining techniques. To address this issue, techniques for privacy-preserving data mining (PPDM) have been proposed. Recently, privacy-preserving utility mining (PPUM) has become an important topic in PPDM. PPUM is the process of hiding sensitive HUIs (SHUIs) appearing in a database, such that the resulting sanitized database will not reveal these itemsets. In the past, the HHUIF and MSICF algorithms were proposed to hide SHUIs, and are the state-of-the-art approaches for PPUM. In this paper, two novel algorithms, namely Maximum Sensitive Utility-MAximum item Utility (MSU-MAU) and Maximum Sensitive Utility-Minimum item Utility (MSU-MIU), are respectively proposed to minimize the side effects of the sanitization process for hiding SHUIs. The proposed algorithms are designed to efficiently delete SHUIs or decrease their utilities using the concepts of maximum and minimum utility. A projection mechanism is also adopted in the two designed algorithms to speed up the sanitization process. Besides, since the evaluation criteria proposed for PPDM are insufficient and inappropriate for evaluating the sanitization performed by PPUM algorithms, this paper introduces three similarity measures to respectively assess the database structure, database utility and item utility of a sanitized database. These criteria are proposed as a new evaluation standard for PPUM. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Data-driven multivariate power curve modeling of offshore wind turbines
SO ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB Performance monitoring of offshore wind turbines is an essential first step in the condition monitoring process. This paper provides three novelties regarding power curve modeling. The first consists of illustrating that univariate power curve modeling can be improved by the use of non-parametric methods such as stochastic gradient boosted regression trees, extremely randomized forest, random forest, K-nearest neighbors, and the method of bins according to the IEC standard 61,400-12-1. This is confirmed on both a synthetic data set and a real live data set containing data from three offshore wind turbines. The second novelty consists of an improvement regarding overall power curve modeling results by the use of multivariate models which incorporate the wind direction, rotations per minute of the rotor, yaw, wind direction and pitch additional to the wind speed. The best improvement is achieved by the stochastic gradient boosted regression trees method for which the mean absolute error can be decreased by up to 27.66%. The third novelty consists of making a synthetic data set available for bench-marking purposes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Remoteness from sources of persistent organic pollutants in the
   multi-media global environment
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB Quantifying the remoteness from sources of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) can inform the design of monitoring studies and the interpretation of measurement data. Previous work on quantifying remoteness has not explicitly considered partitioning between the gas phase and aerosols, and between the atmosphere and the Earth's surface. The objective of this study is to present a metric of remoteness for POPs transported through the atmosphere calculated with a global multimedia fate model, BETR-Research. We calculated the remoteness of regions covering the entire globe from emission sources distributed according to light emissions, and taking into account the multimedia partitioning properties of chemicals and using averaged global climate data. Remoteness for hypothetical chemicals with distinct partitioning properties (volatile, seimi-volatile, hydrophilic, low-volatility) and having two different half-lives in air (60-day and 2-day) are presented. Differences in remoteness distribution among the hypothetical chemicals are most pronounced in scenarios assuming 60-day half-life in air. In scenarios with a 2-day half-life in air, degradation dominates over wet and dry deposition processes as a pathway for atmospheric removal of all chemicals except the low-volatility chemical. The remoteness distribution of the low-volatility chemical is strongly dependent on assumptions about degradability on atmospheric aerosols. Calculations that considered seasonal variability in temperature, hydroxyl radical concentrations in the atmosphere and global atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns indicate that variability in hydroxyl radical concentrations largely determines the seasonal variability of remoteness. Concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) measured in tree bark from around the world are more highly correlated with remoteness calculated using our methods than with proximity to human population, and we see considerable potential to apply remoteness calculations for interpretation of monitoring data collected under programs such as the Stockholm Convention Global Monitoring Plan.

TI Retrospective analysis of "new" flame retardants in the global
   atmosphere under the GAPS Network
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB A retrospective analysis was conducted on air samples that were collected in 2005 under the Global Atmospheric Passive Sampling (GAPS) Network around the time period when the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants came into force. Results are presented for several new flame retardants, including hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), which was recently listed under the Convention (2013). These results represent the first global-scale distributions in air for these compounds. The targeted compounds are shown to have unique global distributions in air, which highlights, the challenges in understanding the sources and environmental fate of each chemical, and ultimately in their assessments as persistent organic pollutants. The study also demonstrates the feasibility of using the PUF disk passive Air Sampler to study these new flame retardants in air, many of which exist entirely in the particle-phase as demonstrated in this study using a K-OA-based partitioning model.

TI Seed dispersal distances by ant partners reflect preferential
   recruitment patterns in two ant-dispersed sedges
SO EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY
AB An important feature of seed dispersal mutualism is the differentiation of dispersal-related seed traits (dispersal syndrome), which potentially contribute to partitioning of both seed dispersers and regeneration sites among sympatric plants. Yet, the selective factors underlying the diversity in dispersal syndromes are largely unknown. The differential requirements for seed dispersal distances are often proposed as a main factor in plant adaptations to disperser animals. Focusing on two sympatric ant-dispersed sedges Carex lanceolata and Carex tristachya (Cyperaceae), we tested the association of the adaptation to different dispersers with requirements for seed dispersal distances. We found that C. lanceolata was more frequently dispersed by the large ant Formica japonica (which had relatively long dispersal distances compared with other smaller ants) than by C. tristachya, and this was caused by the higher seed attractiveness of C. lanceolata to F. japonica. Pot experiments manipulating adult-to-seedling distances showed that isolation from conspecific adults only benefited C. lanceolata seedlings, and C. tristachya seedlings were not affected. These results support the importance of differential requirements for seed dispersal distances as a factor underlying the diversity in dispersal syndromes among animal-dispersed plants.

TI Molecular characterization of southern bluefin tuna myoglobin (Thunnus
   maccoyii)
SO FISH PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY
AB The primary structure of southern bluefin tuna Thunnus maccoyii Mb has been elucidated by molecular cloning techniques. The cDNA of this tuna encoding Mb contained 776 nucleotides, with an open reading frame of 444 nucleotides encoding 147 amino acids. The nucleotide sequence of the coding region was identical to those of other bluefin tunas (T. thynnus and T. orientalis), thus giving the same amino acid sequences. Based on the deduced amino acid sequence, bioinformatic analysis was performed including phylogenic tree, hydropathy plot and homology modeling. In order to investigate the autoxidation profiles, the isolation of Mb was performed from the dark muscle. The water soluble fraction was subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation (60-90 % saturation) followed by preparative gel electrophoresis. Autoxidation profiles of Mb were delineated at pH 5.6, 6.5 and 7.4 at temperature 37 degrees C. The autoxidation rate of tuna Mb was slightly higher than that of horse Mb at all pH examined. These results revealed that tuna myoglobin was unstable than that of horse Mb mainly at acidic pH.

TI Latent preferences of residents regarding an urban forest recreation
   setting in Ljubljana, Sloveni
SO FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB The goal of this study is to assess residents' preferences for a set of attributes describing the recreation setting in an urban forest (outstanding trees, forest openings, waymarks and information boards, and paved walking trails) and to explore the heterogeneity of those preferences. It was captured by a four-class latent class model used to segment a sample of residents of Ljubljana (the capital of Slovenia), who responded to a choice experiment-based poll. The survey focused on the Roznik urban forest, for which preferences (also willingness-to-pay) for hypothetical changes in the attributes were assessed. Respondents in class 1 were invariant to changes in the recreation setting. Those in class 2 and 4 stated positive preferences for having more outstanding trees. Class 3 and 4 were in favour of increasing the area of forest openings and enhancing the maintenance of waymarks and information boards. Those in class 4 expressed positive preferences for more walking trails, whereas class 3 valued this negatively. Class membership was affected by respondent age, number of adults in the household, frequency of forest visits, income, and purpose of the visit. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Spatialising the Melanesian Canarium industry: Understanding economic
   upgrading in an emerging industry among three Pacific small island
   states
SO GEOFORUM
AB This paper examines economic upgrading in the Canarium indicum (Canarium) nut industry in Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea. Canarium is a tree that is indigenous to Melanesia, and has been the subject of several commercialisation attempts since 1988. The paper assesses the outcomes to various actors in the Canarium supply chain from attempts to upgrade industry products and processes by: (1) increasing the available resource in suitable locations; (2) improving nut products and processing techniques; (3) increasing actors' knowledge and supply chain coordination; and (4) establishing product standards. A two-phase data generation process was implemented. Document analysis and participant observations of industry workshops initiated a set of four economic upgrading interventions that were adaptively implemented. A second stage of workshops and 76 interviews enabled outcomes to be assessed at the project's end. Findings suggest that a small number of urban-based entrepreneurs benefit and subsequently are lead actors in industry development, but at the expense of benefits being distributed to a larger, more spatially disparate group of smallholder and small commercial growers. These economic upgrading outcomes are circumscribed by core-periphery relations in Pacific small island states and the scale of industry in each country. Thus, spatial inequalities are reproduced through the emerging Canarium industries. We argue that different routes to industry development are required in each country. Development initiatives that capitalise on the benefits of micro-enterprise clusters, joint action and regional institutional arrangements are proposed to overcome the impediments imposed by the particular geographies of Pacific island states.

TI Forest offsets and the California compliance market: Bringing an
   abstract ecosystem good to market
SO GEOFORUM
AB Improved Forest Management (IFM) projects under the California cap-and-trade market allow production of new, non-traditional commodities: forest carbon offsets. Earlier analyses have considered forest offsets generated through tree planting in the Global South, as vehicles for sustainable development. However, the California IFM program is testing offset production in new geographic and forest management contexts: with offsets produced and consumed within the US on working (timber producing) forests. With data drawn from California IFM project design documents and in-depth interviews with carbon project developers, this study traces the development, sale, and maintenance of forest offsets, in order to map access to benefits along the commodity chain. Results reveal that the cost and complexity of rendering biological services 'real' for market legitimacy are reducing benefits to marginal landowners, who lack needed capital, knowledge, and technology to bring offsets to market. An important insight of this study is that the state has maintained power over program participation and offset supply through control of the forest offset methodology, creating a production process largely mediated by the state, adding risk and uncertainty to market participation. Findings provide an empirical example of neoliberal nature and offer broader lessons on governance and benefit distribution for ecosystem service commodity chains. (C) 2016 The Authors.

TI Securing forests from the scourge of chestnut blight: The biopolitics of
   nature and nation
SO GEOFORUM
AB Bringing a biopolitical framework to bear on historical geographies of nature, this article traces the recent history of the American chestnut, with a focus on the pivotal time period in the early 20th century (1905-1925) during which the tree's ecological, economic, and cultural roles changed dramatically. Once an ecologically dominant and culturally important forest tree in eastern North America, the American chestnut was rendered functionally extinct following the accidental introduction of a fungal pathogen, known as the chestnut blight, at the turn of the 20th century. Calling attention to the historical ties between nature and nation, I demonstrate how blight control, chestnut breeding, and restoration efforts were formulated in conversation with broader anxieties about the fate of the American nation in the wake of social, environmental, economic, and racial change. Through an exploration of three themes distilled from archival research chestnut blight as national threat, fear and desire for exotic nature, and the shared histories of plant breeding and racial improvement this paper illustrates the role that nature has played in the construction and circulation of biopolitical discourses, nationalist sensibilities, and gendered and racial logics.

TI Evidence and future potential of mobile phone data for disease disaster
   management
SO GEOFORUM
AB Global health threats such as the recent Ebola and Zika virus outbreaks require rapid and robust responses to prevent, reduce and recover from disease dispersion. As part of broader big data and digital humanitarianism discourses, there is an emerging interest in data produced through mobile phone communications for enhancing the data environment in such circumstances. This paper assembles user perspectives and critically examines existing evidence and future potential of mobile phone data derived from call detail records (CDRs) and two-way short message service (SMS) platforms, for managing and responding to humanitarian disasters caused by communicable disease outbreaks. We undertake a scoping review of relevant literature and in-depth interviews with key informants to ascertain the: (i) information that can be gathered from CDRs or SMS data; (ii) phase(s) in the disease disaster management cycle when mobile data may be useful; (iii) value added over conventional approaches to data collection and transfer; (iv) barriers and enablers to use of mobile data in disaster contexts; and (v) the social and ethical challenges. Based on this evidence we develop a typology of mobile phone data sources, types, and end-uses, and a decision-tree for mobile data use, designed to enable effective use of mobile data for disease disaster management. We show that mobile data holds great potential for improving the quality, quantity and timing of selected information required for disaster management, but that testing and evaluation of the benefits, constraints and limitations of mobile data use in a wider range of mobile-user and disaster contexts is needed to fully understand its utility, validity, and limitations.

TI New plane-sweep algorithms for distance-based join queries in spatial
   databases
SO GEOINFORMATICA
AB Efficient and effective processing of the distance-based join query (DJQ) is of great importance in spatial databases due to the wide area of applications that may address such queries (mapping, urban planning, transportation planning, resource management, etc.). The most representative and studied DJQs are the K Closest Pairs Query (KCPQ) and epsilon Distance Join Query (epsilon DJQ). These spatial queries involve two spatial data sets and a distance function to measure the degree of closeness, along with a given number of pairs in the final result (K) or a distance threshold (epsilon). In this paper, we propose four new plane-sweep-based algorithms for KCPQs and their extensions for epsilon DJQs in the context of spatial databases, without the use of an index for any of the two disk-resident data sets (since, building and using indexes is not always in favor of processing performance). They employ a combination of plane-sweep algorithms and space partitioning techniques to join the data sets. Finally, we present results of an extensive experimental study, that compares the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms for KCPQs and epsilon DJQs. This performance study, conducted on medium and big spatial data sets (real and synthetic) validates that the proposed plane-sweep-based algorithms are very promising in terms of both efficient and effective measures, when neither inputs are indexed. Moreover, the best of the new algorithms is experimentally compared to the best algorithm that is based on the R-tree (a widely accepted access method), for KCPQs and epsilon DJQs, using the same data sets. This comparison shows that the new algorithms outperform R-tree based algorithms, in most cases.

TI Efficient indexing and retrieval of large-scale geo-tagged video
   databases
SO GEOINFORMATICA
AB We are witnessing a significant growth in the number of smartphone users and advances in phone hardware and sensor technology. In conjunction with the popularity of video applications such as YouTube, an unprecedented number of user-generated videos (UGVs) are being generated and consumed by the public, which leads to a Big Data challenge in social media. In a very large video repository, it is difficult to index and search videos in their unstructured form. However, due to recent development, videos can be geo-tagged (e.g., locations from GPS receiver and viewing directions from digital compass) at the acquisition time, which can provide potential for efficient management of video data. Ideally, each video frame can be tagged by the spatial extent of its coverage area, termed Field-Of-View (FOV). This effectively converts a challenging video management problem into a spatial database problem. This paper attacks the challenges of large-scale video data management using spatial indexing and querying of FOVs, especially maximally harnessing the geographical properties of FOVs. Since FOVs are shaped similar to slices of pie and contain both location and orientation information, conventional spatial indexes, such as R-tree, cannot index them efficiently. The distribution of UGVs' locations is non-uniform (e.g., more FOVs in popular locations). Consequently, even multilevel grid-based indexes, which can handle both location and orientation, have limitations in managing the skewed distribution. Additionally, since UGVs are usually captured in a casual way with diverse setups and movements, no a priori assumption can be made to condense them in an index structure. To overcome the challenges, we propose a class of new R-tree-based index structures that effectively harness FOVs' camera locations, orientations and view-distances, in tandem, for both filtering and optimization. We also present novel search strategies and algorithms for efficient range and directional queries on our indexes. Our experiments using both real-world and large synthetic video datasets (over 30 years' worth of videos) demonstrate the scalability and efficiency of our proposed indexes and search algorithms.

TI Study of genetic diversity of killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor
   loci in the Tujia ethnic minority
SO HUMAN IMMUNOLOGY
AB The aim of this study was to analyze the genetic profiles of 14 killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) genes and 2 pseudogenes of 124 individuals from Tujia ethnic minority residing in Enshi Tujia and Miao autonomous prefecture of Hubei province of China and investigate the genetic relationships between the Tujia ethnic minority and other reported groups for the first time. Sequence specific primer amplification (PCR-SSP) methods were used to genotype the 14 KIR genes and 2 pseudogenes. The observed carrier frequencies (OF) and the gene frequencies (GF) of the KIR genes were measured. Neighbor-joining (N-J) tree and the principal component analysis (PCA) plot were constructed. All individuals were typed positive for the three framework loci KIR3DL3, 2DL4 and 3DL2, as well as for pseudogene KIR3DP1. The gene frequencies of the other KIR genes ranged from 9% in KIR2DS2 to 98% in KIR2DP1 and KIR3DL1. The present study of the KIR genes may be a powerful tool for enriching the Chinese ethnical gene information resources of the KIR gene pool, as well as for the anthropological research.

TI Distribution of Marburg virus in Africa: An evolutionary approach
SO INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION
AB The aim of this study was to investigate the origin and geographical dispersion of Marburg virus, the first member of the Filoviridae family to be discovered. Seventy-three complete genome sequences of Marburg virus isolated from animals and humans were retrieved from public databases and analysed using a Bayesian phylogeographical framework. The phylogenetic tree of the Marburg virus data set showed two significant evolutionary lineages: Ravn virus (RAVV) and Marburg virus (MARV). MARV divided into two main clades; clade A included isolates from Uganda (five from the European epidemic in 1967), Kenya (1980) and Angola (from the epidemic of 2004-2005); clade B included most of the isolates obtained during the 1999-2000 epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and a group of Ugandan isolates obtained in 2007-2009. The estimated mean evolutionary rate of the whole genome was 3.3 x 10(-4) substitutions/site/year (credibility interval 2.0-4.8). The MARV strain had a mean root time of the most recent common ancestor of 177.9 years ago (YA) (95% highest posterior density 87-284), thus indicating that it probably originated in the mid-XIX century, whereas the RAVV strain had a later origin dating back to a mean 33.8 YA. The most probable location of the MARV ancestor was Uganda (state posterior probability, spp = 0.41), whereas that of the RAVV ancestor was Kenya (spp = 0.71). There were significant migration rates from Uganda to the DRC (Bayes Factor, BF=42.0) and in the opposite direction (BF = 5.7). Our data suggest that Uganda may have been the cradle of Marburg virus in Africa. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI The complete genomic analysis of an imported Vibrio cholerae from
   Myanmar in southwest China
SO INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION
AB We sequenced and analyzed an imported Vibrio cholerae from Mynamar in 2011 by using whole genome sequencing method in Yunnan Province, southwest China. Other 3 isolates of V. cholerae in Yunnan were also sequenced for comparing purpose. Illumina Hiseq2500 was used and the sequencing results were assembled and annotated. The comparative genomic analysis was also performed with 101 reference strains from China and abroad. The results showed the imported V. cholerae (YN2011004) had two chromosomes and one plasmid; chr1 contained 2727 predicted genes, and 958 genes for chr2. Phylogenomic tree results showed YN2011004 belonged to the seventh pandemic strain, clustered into wave 3 and clade 3B. The strain had the highly homology with SN083 and 4remapscaff isolated in 2010 from other parts of China, and clustered with SN117, VC50 remapscaff, VC57 remapscaff and SN034. These references V. cholerae mostly isolated from coastal areas of China in 2008. For the other 3 strains' comparison, it suggested that V. cholerae in 1990s in Yunnan had the close relationship with the prevalence of cholera in Southeast Asia. Therefore, we thought that the cholera in Yunnan was consistent with the epidemic trend of China, being the "sink" for external source and also acted as a "source" for spread. Moreover, we considered that the imported V. cholerae from Myanmar in 2011 actually was the exported strain from China, and it provided us a new sight for the bacterial change and evolution.

TI Sequence diversity and positive selection at the Duffy-binding protein
   genes of Plasmodium knowlesi and P-cynomolgi: Analysis of the complete
   coding sequences of Thai isolates
SO INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION
AB Plasmodium knowlesi and P. cynomolgi are simian malaria parasites capable of causing symptomatic human infections. The interaction between the Duffy binding protein alpha on P. knowlesi merozoite and the Duffy-antigen receptor for chemokine (DARC) on human and macaque erythrocyte membrane is prerequisite for establishment of blood stage infection whereas DARC is not required for erythrocyte invasion by P. cynomolgi. To gain insights into the evolution of the PkDBP gene family comprising PkDBP alpha, PkDBP beta and PkDBP gamma, and a member of the DBP gene family of P. cynomolgi (PcyDBP1), the complete coding sequences of these genes were analyzed from Thai field isolates and compared with the publicly available DBP sequences of P. vivax (PvDBP). The complete coding sequences of PkDBP alpha (n = 11), PkDBP beta (n = 11), PkDBP gamma (n = 10) and PcyDBP1 (n = 11) were obtained from direct sequencing of the PCR products. Nucleotide diversity of DBP is highly variable across malaria species. PcyDBP1 displayed the greatest level of nucleotide diversity while all PkDBP gene members exhibited comparable levels of diversity. Positive selection occurred in domains I, II and IV of PvDBP and in domain V of PcyDBP1. Although deviation from neutrality was not detected in domain II of PkDBPa, a signature of positive selection was identified in the putative DARC binding site in this domain. The DBP gene families seem to have arisen following the model of concerted evolution because paralogs rather than orthologs are clustered in the phylogenetic tree. The presence of identical or closely related repeats exclusive for the PkDBP gene family suggests that duplication of gene members postdated their divergence from the ancestral PcyDBP and PvDBP lineages. Intragenic recombination was detected in all DBP genes of these malaria species. Despite the limited number of isolates, P. knowlesi from Thailand shared phylogenetically related domain II sequences of both PkDBPa and PkDBP. with those from Peninsular Malaysia, consistent with their geographic proximity.

TI Multilocus sequence typing of Candida tropicalis shows clonal cluster
   enrichment in azole-resistant isolates from patients in Shanghai, China
SO INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION
AB To explore the putative correlation between themultilocus sequence types (MLST) and antifungal susceptibility of clinical Candida tropicalis isolates in Mainland China. Eighty-two clinical C. tropicalis isolates were collected from sixty-nine patients at Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China, from July 2012 to February 2015, and antifungal susceptibility tests were performed. Genetic profiles of those 82 isolates (30 azole-resistant and 52 azole-susceptible) were characterised by multilocus sequence typing. Phylogenetic analysis of the data was conducted with the clustering method, using UPGMA (unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages) and the minimal spanning tree algorithm. MLST clonal clusters were analysed using the eBURST V3 package. Of the six gene fragments identified in multilocus sequence typing, SAPT4 presented the highest typing efficiency, whereas SAPT2 was the least efficient. Of the 44 diploid sequence types (DSTs) differentiated, 32 DSTs and 12 genotypes were identified as new to the C. tropicalis DST database. Twenty (45.45%) of the 44 DSTs were assigned to seven major groups based on eBURST analysis. Of these, Group 6, which contained DST 376, DST 505, DST 506 and DST 507, accounted for 76.7% of the 30 azole-resistant isolates. However, the genetic relationships among the azole-susceptible isolateswere relatively decentralised. This MLST analysis of the putative correlation between the MLST types and antifungal susceptibility of clinical C. tropicalis isolates in Mainland China shows that DSTs 376, 505, 506 and 507 are closely related azole-resistant C. tropicalis clones.

TI Hypothesis testing clarifies the systematics of the main Central
   American Chagas disease vector, Triatoma dimidiata (Latreille, 1811),
   across its geographic range
SO INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION
AB The widespread and diverse Triatoma dimidiata is the kissing bug species most important for Chagas disease transmission in Central America and a secondary vector in Mexico and northern South America. Its diversity may contribute to different Chagas disease prevalence in different localities and has led to conflicting systematic hypotheses describing various populations as subspecies or cryptic species. To resolve these conflicting hypotheses, we sequenced a nuclear (internal transcribed spacer 2, ITS-2) and mitochondrial gene (cytochrome b) from an extensive sampling of T. dimidiata across its geographic range. We evaluated the congruence of ITS-2 and cyt b phylogenies and tested the support for the previously proposed subspecies (inferred from ITS-2) by: (1) overlaying the ITS-2 subspecies assignments on a cyt b tree and, (2) assessing the statistical support for a cyt b topology constrained by the subspecies hypothesis. Unconstrained phylogenies inferred from ITS-2 and cyt b are congruent and reveal three clades including two putative cryptic species in addition to T. dimidiata sensu stricto. Neither the cyt b phylogeny nor hypothesis testing support the proposed subspecies inferred from ITS-2. Additionally, the two cryptic species are supported by phylogenies inferred from mitochondrially-encoded genes cytochrome c-oxidase I and NADH dehydrogenase 4. In summary, our results reveal two cryptic species. Phylogenetic relationships indicate T. dimidiata sensu stricto is not subdivided into monophyletic clades consistent with subspecies. Based on increased support by hypothesis testing, we propose an updated systematic hypothesis for T. dimidiata based on extensive taxon sampling and analysis of both mitochondrial and nuclear genes.

The obtained sequence types (STs) were compared with those from a heterosexual population from Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
   Methods: Clinical Tunisian patients and female sex workers provided 107 Chlamydia trachomatis positive samples that were used for MLST. Samples from 256 heterosexuals visiting the Amsterdam STI clinic were included as a reference group. Six highly variable genetic regions including the ompA gene were amplified and sequenced. The ST numbers were derived from a Chlamydia typing database (http://mlstdb.uu.se) and used to draw minimum spanning trees.
   Results: ompA sequencing detected 7 genotypes among the Tunisian populations of which genotype E was the most prevalent (66.3%). This genotype E resolved into 23 different STs and among these the ST3 was predominant (53.5%). MLST displayed 43 STs, of which 28 (65%) were new in the database. Minimum spanning tree analysis of all Tunisian samples identified 4 clusters of which one formed a clonal cluster with samples presenting the most prevalent ST3. When comparing samples from the Tunisian and Dutch populations in one minimum spanning tree, there was little overlap between the Chlamydia trachomatis samples.
   Conclusion: The CT-hrMLST scheme allowed us to identify that the Tunisian distribution was dominated by one genotype E ( ST3) strain which is also highly prevalent in many other countries worldwide. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Genotyping of Brucella melitensis and Brucella abortus strains currently
   circulating in Xinjiang, China
SO INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION
AB Brucellosis is a well-known zoonotic disease that can cause severe economic and healthcare losses. Xinjiang, one of the biggest livestock husbandry sectors in China, has gone through increasing incidence of brucellosis in cattle and small ruminants recently. In this paper, 50 B. melitensis strains and 9 B. abortus strains collected from across Xinjiang area (from 2010 to 2015) were genotyped using multiple locus variable-number tandem-repeat (VNTR) analysis (MLVA) and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). Based on 8 loci (MLVA-8), 50 B. melitensis strains were classified into three genotypes. Genotypes 42 (n = 38, 76%) and 63 (n = 11, 22%) were part of the East Mediterranean group, and one genotype with pattern of 1-5-3-13-2-4-3-2 represents a single-locus variant from genotype 63. MLVA-16 resolved 50 B. melitensis strains into 28 genotypes, of which 15 are unique to Xinjiang and 10 are in common with those in adjacent country Kazakhstan and neighboring provinces of China. Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) analysis implies that B. melitensis strains collected from across Kazakhstan, Xinjiang and China areas may share a common origin. Nine B. abortus strains were sorted into three genotypes by MLVA-8, genotypes 36 (n = 7, 77.8%), 86 (n = 1, 11.1%) and a new genotype with pattern of 4-5-3-13-2-2-3-1. Each B. abortus strain showed distinct MLVA-16 genotypes, suggesting that B. abortus species may possess more genetic diversity than B. melitensis. Using MLST, most B. melitensis strains (n = 49) were identified as sequence type ST8, and most B. abortus strains (n = 8) were recognized as ST2. Two new sequence types, ST37 and ST38, represented by single strain from B. melitensis and B. abortus species respectively, were also detected in this study. These results could facilitate the pathogen surveillance in the forthcoming eradication programs and serve as a guide in source tracking in case of new outbreaks occur. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI An Overview on Meshfree Methods: For Computational Solid Mechanics
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL METHODS
AB This review paper presents a methodological study on possible and existing meshfree methods for solving the partial differential equations (PDEs) governing solid mechanics problems, based mainly on the research work in the past two decades at the authors group. We start with a discussion on the general steps in a meshfree method based on nodes, with the displacements as the primary variables. We then examine the major techniques used in each of these steps: (1) techniques for displacement function approximations using nodes, (2) approximation of the gradient of the displacements or strains based on nodes and a background T-cells that can be automatically generated and refined, and (3) formulation techniques for producing algebraic equations. The function approximation techniques include node-based interpolation methods, cell-based interpolation methods, function smoothing techniques, and moving least squares approximation techniques. The gradient approximation includes direct differentiation, gradient smoothing, and special strain construction. Formulation techniques include strong-form, weakform, local weakform, weak-strong-form, and weakened weakform (W2). In theory, a meshfree method can be developed using a combination of function approximation, gradient approximation, and formulation techniques, which can lead to matrix of a large number of possible methods. This review attempts to provide an overall methodological review, rather than a usual review of comparing different methods. We hope to show readers the differences between the forests, and just between the trees.

TI Life cycle assessment of renewable diesel production from
   lignocellulosic biomass
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT
AB Governments around the world encourage the use of biofuels through fuel standard policies that require the addition of renewable diesel in diesel fuel from fossil fuels. Environmental impact studies of the conversion of biomass to renewable diesel have been conducted, and life cycle assessments (LCA) of the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to hydrogenation-derived renewable diesel (HDRD) are limited, especially for countries with cold climates like Canada.
   In this study, an LCA was conducted on converting lignocellulosic biomass to HDRD by estimating the well-to-wheel greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fossil fuel energy input of the production of biomass and its conversion to HDRD. The approach to conduct this LCA includes defining the goal and scope, compiling a life cycle inventory, conducting a life cycle impact assessment, and executing a life cycle interpretation. All GHG emissions and fossil fuel energy inputs were based on a fast pyrolysis plant capacity of 2000 dry tonnes biomass/day. A functional unit of 1 MJ of HDRD produced was adopted as a common unit for data inputs of the life cycle inventory. To interpret the results, a sensitivity analysis was performed to measure the impact of variables involved, and an uncertainty analysis was performed to assess the confidence of the results.
   The GHG emissions of three feedstocks studied-whole tree (i.e., chips from cutting the whole tree), forest residues (i.e., chips from branches and tops generated from logging operations), and agricultural residues (i.e., straw from wheat and barley)-range from 35.4 to 42.3 g CO2,eq/MJ of HDRD (i.e., lowest for agricultural residue- and highest for forest residue-based HDRD); this is 53.4-61.1 % lower than fossil-based diesel. The net energy ratios range from 1.55 to 1.90 MJ/MJ (i.e., lowest for forest residue- and highest for agricultural residue-based HDRD) for HDRD production. The difference in results among feedstocks is due to differing energy requirements to harvest and pretreat biomass. The energy-intensive hydroprocessing stage is responsible for most of the GHG emissions produced for the entire conversion pathway.
   Comparing feedstocks showed the significance of the efficiency in the equipment used and the physical properties of biomass in the production of HDRD. The overall results show the importance of efficiency at the hydroprocessing stage. These findings indicate significant GHG mitigation benefits for the oil refining industry using available lignocellulosic biomass to produce HDRD for transportation fuel.

TI Owner observations regarding cat scratching behavior: an internet-based
   survey
SO JOURNAL OF FELINE MEDICINE AND SURGERY
AB Objectives This study was performed to examine aspects of the cat, environment and scratching post that might influence scratching behavior, in an effort to determine how inappropriate scratching behavior might be refocused on acceptable targets.
   Methods An internet survey, posted on several public websites, gathered details about scratching behavior, as described by owners in their home environments, from 4331 respondents over a 4 month period. Responses from 39 different countries were analyzed, mostly from the USA, Canada and the UK.
   Results Owners offered traditionally recommended scratching substrates including rope, cardboard, carpet and wood. Rope was most frequently used when offered, although carpet was offered most commonly. Most owners provided at least one scratching post; cats scratched the preferred substrate more often when the post was a simple upright type or a cat tree with two or more levels and at least 3 ft high. Narrower posts (base width 3 ft) were used more often than wider posts (base width 5 ft). Intact or neutered cats (males and females) were as likely to scratch inappropriately, and inappropriate scratching decreased with age. Geriatric cats between the ages of 10 and 14 years preferred carpet substrate most frequently; all other ages preferred rope first. Inappropriate scratching decreased as the different types/styles of posts increased in the home. Inappropriate scratching did not increase if the number of cats or dogs increased in the household. Declawed cats were preventatively declawed most often to prevent household item destruction.
   Conclusions and relevance Although cats can have individual preferences, our data provide a starting point for veterinarians recommending scratching posts to clients.

TI Late Holocene pollen record from Fiume Morto (Dead River), a
   palaeomeander of Tiber River near Ancient Ostia (central Italy)
SO JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY
AB Pollen and non pollen palynomorph analyses were carried out in a sediment core (MO2) drilled in the southern lobe of a palaeomeander, Fiume Morto (Dead River), in the Tiber delta area, near Ancient Ostia (central Italy). Since the Roman period, the Tiber River flowed close to Ancient Ostia and its saltworks, Salinae Ostiensis. The Tiber meander was cut off during the Tiber River flood of 1557 AD and transformed into an oxbow lake. During the nineteenth century the Fiume Morto pond was reclaimed and at present the area is about 3 km distant from the present shoreline and intensely transformed by human settlements. According to radiocarbon dates, the pollen record, not continuous, spans from the fourth century BC to the nineteenth century AD. It shows first a riverine phase before the meander cut off of sixteenth century AD and probably only the last centuries BC were preserved from erosion. The river deposits record riparian vegetation (mainly tamarisk and alder) with mesophilous (mainly deciduous oaks) and Mediterranean (mainly evergreen oaks, heather and olive tree) elements. The human presence is clear, probably related to the development of Ancient Ostia and evidenced by synanthropic taxa. The second phase corresponds to the oxbow lake formed after the meander cut off. Several peaks of pine pollen are tentatively ascribed to Tiber flood events: the first peak is found just in correspondence with the meander cut off at 1557 AD. The numerous floods we interpret in the following part of the diagram could be linked to the increase in extreme events and precipitation that occurred during the Little Ice Age. The last phase, in which freshwater plants are present and chenopods decrease, shows the saltworks abandonment that occurred in nineteenth century. This study turned out to be of key relevance to reconstruct the palaeoenvironmental evolution of the ancient Holocene Tiber meander during the last two and a half millennia.

TI Collophora hispanica, a New Pathogen and Potential Threat to the Almond
   Industry in Iran
SO JOURNAL OF PHYTOPATHOLOGY
AB Trunk diseases are potential threats for almond productivity and longevity worldwide, including Iran. In a recent survey on fungal species associated with trunk diseases of almonds in north-western Iran, Collophora isolates (tentatively identified as Collophora hispanica) were recovered with high frequency from wood samples with internal necrosis and brown to black vascular streaking of almond trees showing symptoms of decline. However, the pathogenic potential of Collophora isolates on almond trees in Iran remains unproven. In this study, the identity of the isolates was further confirmed as C.hispanica based on a combination of morphological data and sequence data of ITS-rDNA region, and pathogenicity of C.hispanica isolates on almond was evaluated using excised shoot method and in greenhouse experiments. Collophora hispanica isolates induced lesions statistically different from the control, in both excised shoot method and greenhouse assays. Significant differences were observed among the isolates in the length of the lesion induced on wood. Collophora hispanica should be considered as the main trunk pathogens of almond trees in north-western region of Iran. The distribution and host range of this new pathogen on almond remains to be studied.

TI Expanded Strain-Specific RT-PCR Assay for Differential Detection of
   Currently Known Citrus Tristeza Virus Strains: a Useful Screening Tool
SO JOURNAL OF PHYTOPATHOLOGY
AB Genotypic characterization of Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) strains has progressed significantly, but their phenotypic expression is poorly established as CTV naturally occurs as mixed-strain populations. A screening system for the analysis of mixed-strain populations is required for population studies and the correlation with symptom expression. In this study, a published CTV strain-specific detection assay was expanded and improved to facilitate detection of currently known CTV strains. Supplementary RT-PCR assays were developed for two variant groups of the RB strain and the HA16-5 strain, and assays for the T36 strain and generic CTV detection were improved. The value of the strain-specific assays was shown by the ability to identify the strain components of two CTV cross-protecting sources, GFMS35 and LMS6, used in the South African budwood certification scheme and to demonstrate the segregation of strains in budwood source trees.

TI Plant Host and Geographic Location Drive Endophyte Community Composition
   in the Face of Perturbation
SO MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
AB All plants form symbioses with endophytic fungi, which affect host plant health and function. Most endophytic fungi are horizontally transmitted, and consequently, local environment and geographic location greatly influence endophyte community composition. Growing evidence also suggests that identity of the plant host (e.g., species, genotype) can be important in shaping endophyte communities. However, little is known about how disturbances to plants affect their fungal symbiont communities. The goal of this study was to test if disturbances, from both natural and anthropogenic sources, can alter endophyte communities independent of geographic location or plant host identity. Using the plant species white snakeroot (Ageratina altissima; Asteraceae), we conducted two experiments that tested the effect of perturbation on endophyte communities. First, we examined endophyte response to leaf mining insect activity, a natural perturbation, in three replicate populations. Second, for one population, we applied fungicide to plant leaves to test endophyte community response to an anthropogenic perturbation. Using culture-based methods and Sanger sequencing of fungal isolates, we then examined abundance, diversity, and community structure of endophytic fungi in leaves subjected to perturbations by leaf mining and fungicide application. Our results show that plant host individual and geographic location are the major determinants of endophyte community composition even in the face of perturbations. Unexpectedly, we found that leaf mining did not impact endophyte communities in white snakeroot, but fungicide treatment resulted in small but significant changes in endophyte community structure. Together, our results suggest that endophyte communities are highly resistant to biotic and anthropogenic disturbances.

TI Desert Perennial Shrubs Shape the Microbial-Community Miscellany in
   Laimosphere and Phyllosphere Space
SO MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
AB Microbial function, composition, and distribution play a fundamental role in ecosystem ecology. The interaction between desert plants and their associated microbes is expected to greatly affect their response to changes in this harsh environment. Using comparative analyses, we studied the impact of three desert shrubs, Atriplex halimus (A), Artemisia herba-alba (AHA), and Hammada scoparia (HS), on soil- and leaf-associated microbial communities. DNA extracted from the leaf surface and soil samples collected beneath the shrubs were used to study associated microbial diversity using a sequencing survey of variable regions of bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS1). We found that the composition of bacterial and fungal orders is plant-type-specific, indicating that each plant type provides a suitable and unique microenvironment. The different adaptive ecophysiological properties of the three plant species and the differential effect on their associated microbial composition point to the role of adaptation in the shaping of microbial diversity. Overall, our findings suggest a link between plant ecophysiological adaptation as a "temporary host" and the biotic-community parameters in extreme xeric environments.

TI Evidence for an Opportunistic and Endophytic Lifestyle of the
   Bursaphelenchus xylophilus-Associated Bacteria Serratia marcescens
   PWN146 Isolated from Wilting Pinus pinaster
SO MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
AB Pine wilt disease (PWD) results from the interaction of three elements: the pathogenic nematode, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus; the insect-vector, Monochamus sp.; and the host tree, mostly Pinus species. Bacteria isolated from B. xylophilus may be a fourth element in this complex disease. However, the precise role of bacteria in this interaction is unclear as both plant-beneficial and as plant-pathogenic bacteria may be associated with PWD. Using whole genome sequencing and phenotypic characterization, we were able to investigate in more detail the genetic repertoire of Serratia marcescens PWN146, a bacterium associated with B. xylophilus. We show clear evidence that S. marcescens PWN146 is able to withstand and colonize the plant environment, without having any deleterious effects towards a susceptible host (Pinus thunbergii), B. xylophilus nor to the nematode model C. elegans. This bacterium is able to tolerate growth in presence of xenobiotic/organic compounds, and use phenylacetic acid as carbon source. Furthermore, we present a detailed list of S. marcescens PWN146 potentials to interfere with plant metabolism via hormonal pathways and/or nutritional acquisition, and to be competitive against other bacteria and/or fungi in terms of resource acquisition or production of antimicrobial compounds. Further investigation is required to understand the role of bacteria in PWD. We have now reinforced the theory that B. xylophilus-associated bacteria may have a plant origin.

TI Galaxies in the EAGLE hydrodynamical simulation and in the Durham and
   Munich semi-analytical models
SO MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
AB We compare global predictions from the EAGLE hydrodynamical simulation, and two semianalytic (SA) models of galaxy formation, L-GALAXIES and GALFORM. All three models include the key physical processes for the formation and evolution of galaxies and their parameters are calibrated against a small number of observables at z approximate to 0. The two SA models have been applied to merger trees constructed from the EAGLE dark matter only simulation. We find that at z <= 2, both the galaxy stellar mass functions for stellar masses M-* < 10(10.5) M-circle dot and the median specific star formation rates (sSFRs) in the three models agree to better than 0.4 dex. The evolution of the sSFR predicted by the three models closely follows the mass assembly history of dark matter haloes. In both EAGLE and L-GALAXIES there are more central passive galaxies with M-* < 10(9.5) M-circle dot than in GALFORM. This difference is related to galaxies that have entered and then left a larger halo and which are treated as satellites in GALFORM. In the range 0 < z < 1, the slope of the evolution of the star formation rate density in EAGLE is a factor of approximate to 1.5 steeper than for the two SA models. The median sizes for galaxies with M-* > 10(9.5) M-circle dot differ in some instances by an order of magnitude, while the stellar mass-size relation in EAGLE is a factor of approximate to 2 tighter than for the two SA models. Our results suggest the need for a revision of how SA models treat the effect of baryonic self-gravity on the underlying dark matter. The treatment of gas flows in the models needs to be revised based on detailed comparison with observations to understand in particular the evolution of the stellar mass-metallicity relation.

TI Phenological visual rhythms: Compact representations for fine-grained
   plant species identification
SO PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS
AB Plant phenology, the study of recurrent life cycles events and its relationship to climate, is a key discipline in climate change research. In this context, digital cameras have been effectively used to monitor leaf flushing and senescence on vegetations across the world. A primary condition for the phenological observation refers to the correct identification of plants by taking into account time series associated with their crowns in the digital images. In this paper, we present a novel approach for representing phenological patterns of plant species. The proposed method is based on encoding time series as a visual rhythm. Here, we focus on applications of our approach for plant species identification. In this scenario, visual rhythms are characterized by image description algorithms. A comparative analysis of different descriptors is conducted and discussed. Experimental results show that our approach presents high accuracy on identifying individual plant species from its specific visual rhythm. Additionally, our representation is compact, making it suitable for long-term data series. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Annona coriacea Mart. (araticum) is a widely distributed tree in the cerrado. Its value is attributed principally to the consumption of its fruit which possesses a large nutritive potential. The objective was to identify the chemical profile and evaluate the antimicrobial and cytoprotective activity of the hydroethanol extract of A. coriacea Mart. (HEAC) leaves against the toxicity of mercury chloride. Materials and Methods: The characterization of components was carried out using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by microdilution method in broth with strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. For evaluation of the modulatory and cytoprotective activity of aminoglycoside antibiotics (gentamicin and amikacin) and mercury chloride (HgCl2), the substances were associated with the HEAC at subinhibitory concentrations (MIC/8). Results and Discussion: The HPLC analysis revealed the presence of flavonoids such as Luteolin (1.84%) and Quercetin (1.19%) in elevated concentrations. The HEAC presented an MIC >= 512 mg/mL and significant antagonistic action in aminoglycosides modulation, and it also showed cytoprotective activity to S. aureus (significance P 0.0001) and E. coli(significance P 0.05) bacteria against the mercury chloride heavy metal with significance, this action being attributed to the chelating properties of the flavonoids found in the chemical identification. Conclusions: The results acquired in this study show that the HEAC presents cytoprotective activity over the tested strains in vitro and can also present antagonistic effect when associated with aminoglycosides, reinforcing the necessity of taking caution when combining natural and pharmaceutical products.

TI The Mexican Drought Atlas: Tree-ring reconstructions of the soil
   moisture balance during the late pre-Hispanic, colonial, and modern eras
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB Mexico has suffered a long history and prehistory of severe sustained drought. Drought over Mexico is modulated by ocean-atmospheric variability in the Atlantic and Pacific, raising the possibility for long-range seasonal climate forecasting, which could help mediate the economic and social impacts of future dry spells. The instrumental record of Mexican climate is very limited before 1920, but tree-ring chronologies developed from old-growth forests in Mexico can provide an excellent proxy representation of the spatial pattern and intensity of past moisture regimes useful for the analysis of climate dynamics and climate impacts. The Mexican Drought Atlas (MXDA) has been developed from an extensive network of 252 climate sensitive tree-ring chronologies in and near Mexico. The MXDA reconstructions extend from 1400 CE-2012 and were calibrated with the instrumental summer WA) self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index (scPDSI) on a 0.5 degrees latitude/longitude grid extending over land areas from 14 to 34 degrees N and 75-120 degrees W using Ensemble Point-by-Point Regression (EPPR) for the 1944-1984 period. The grid point reconstructions were validated for the period 1920-1943 against instrumental gridded scPDSI values based on the fewer weather station observations available during that interval. The MXDA provides a new spatial perspective on the historical impacts of moisture extremes over Mexico during the past 600-years, including the Aztec Drought of One Rabbit in 1454, the drought of El Ano de Hambre in 1785-1786, and the drought that preceded the Mexican Revolution of 1909-1910.
   The El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the most important ocean-atmospheric forcing of moisture variability detected with the MXDA. In fact, the reconstructions suggest that the strongest central equatorial Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) teleconnection to the soil moisture balance over North America may reside in northern Mexico. This ENSO signal has stronger and more time-stable correlations than computed for either the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation or Pacific Decadal Oscillation. The extended Multivariate ENSO Index is most highly correlated with reconstructed scPDSI over northern Mexico, where warm events favor moist conditions during the winter, spring, and early summer. This ENSO teleconnection to northern Mexico has been strong over the past 150 years, but it has been comparatively weak and non-stationary in the MXDA over central and southern Mexico where eastern tropical Pacific and Caribbean/tropical Atlantic SSTs seem to be more important. The ENSO teleconnection to northern Mexico is weaker in the available instrumental PDSI, but analyses based on the millennium climate simulations with the Community Earth System Model suggest that the moisture balance during the winter, spring, and early summer over northern Mexico may indeed be particularly sensitive to ENSO forcing. Nationwide drought is predicted to become more common with anthropogenic climate change, but the MXDA reconstructions indicate that intense "All Mexico" droughts have been rare over the past 600 years and their frequency does not appear to have increased substantially in recent decades.

TI Glacier fluctuations during the past 2000 years
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB A global compilation of glacier advances and retreats for the past two millennia grouped by 17 regions (excluding Antarctica) highlights the nature of glacier fluctuations during the late Holocene. The dataset includes 275 time series of glacier fluctuations based on historical, tree ring, lake sediment, radiocarbon and terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide data. The most detailed and reliable series for individual glaciers and regional compilations are compared with summer temperature and, when available, winter precipitation reconstructions, the most important parameters for glacier mass balance. In many cases major glacier advances correlate with multi-decadal periods of decreased summer temperature. In a few cases, such as in Arctic Alaska and western Canada, some glacier advances occurred during relatively warm wet times. The timing and scale of glacier fluctuations over the past two millennia varies greatly from region to region. However, the number of glacier advances shows a clear pattern for the high, mid and low latitudes and, hence, points to common forcing factors acting at the global scale. Globally, during the first millennium CE glaciers were smaller than between the advances in 13th to early 20th centuries CE. The precise extent of glacier retreat in the first millennium is not well defined; however, the most conservative estimates indicate that during the 1st and 2nd centuries in some regions glaciers were smaller than at the end of 20th/early 21st centuries. Other periods of glacier retreat are identified regionally during the 5th and 8th centuries in the European Alps, in the 3rd-6th and 9th centuries in Norway, during the 10th-13th centuries in southern Alaska, and in the 18th century in Spitsbergen. However, no single period of common global glacier retreat of centennial duration, except for the past century, has yet been identified. In contrast, the view that the Little Ice Age was a period of global glacier expansion beginning in the 13th century (or earlier) and reaching a maximum in 17th-19th centuries is supported by our data. The pattern of glacier variations in the past two millennia corresponds with cooling in reconstructed temperature records at the continental and hemispheric scales. The number of glacier advances also broadly matches periods showing high volcanic activity and low solar irradiance over the past two millennia, although the resolution of most glacier chronologies is not enough for robust statistical correlations. Glacier retreat in the past 100-150 years corresponds to the anthropogenic global temperature increase. Many questions concerning the relative strength of forcing factors that drove glacier variations in the past 2 ka still remain. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Multi-decadal periods of enhanced aeolian activity on the north-eastern
   Tibet Plateau during the last 2ka
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB The north-eastern Tibetan Plateau is regarded as key area for the understanding of the Holocene paleoclimate in central Asia. During the last decade a special emphasis has been placed on multi-decadal to millennial scale climate fluctuations, especially in the context of the recent climate change. However, most reconstructions are based on lake sediments, tree rings and speleothems whereas only little information from terrestrial archives is included. This study presents multi-decadal scale climate fluctuations based on optical stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages from aeolian sediments from three catchment areas. Six phases of enhanced aeolian accumulation during the last 2000 years, each lasting around 80-200 years were identified. The first three phases (1630-1725 CE, 1450-1530 CE and 1250-1350 CE) occurred during the Little Ice Age; the other three (750-950 CE, 390-540 CE, 50-225 CE) during the so-called dark ages cooling. Aeolian processes were strongly reduced during the medieval climate anomaly. A comparison with other proxy records indicates that the formation of aeolian archives on the north-eastern Tibetan Plateau during the late Holocene is facilitated by cool and dry climate conditions during times of weaker Asian Summer Monsoon and probably enhanced westerlies. The results show that short term climate fluctuations can be reconstructed from non-continuous and heterogeneous terrestrial archives in a semi-arid environment, provided a sufficient number of OSL ages from aeolian sediments is available.

TI The timing and importance of arboriculture and agroforestry in a
   temperate East Polynesia Society, the Moriori, Rekohu (Chatham Island)
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB Identifying arboriculture and agroforestry in Polynesian Societies has usually relied heavily upon the ethnographic record in the absence of direct archaeological evidence. In this paper we outline a multi proxy research design, including ethnography, palynology, anthracology, archaeology and a high precision chronology to evaluate arboriculture and agroforestry as components of Moriori subsistence practices before the arrival of Europeans in 1791. The colonisers of Rekohu brought with them a mainland New Zealand endemic tree, Corynocarpus laevigatus, and the technology to propagate the tree in a less than ideal climate and to process its drupe into a storable source of carbohydrate in what was a difficult environment for Polynesian cultivation practices. We also present a conceptual model of forest change due to Moriori fuel selection practices which suggests that Moriori were actively managing these forest spaces for food, fuel, medicine, construction material and as a habitation space, therefore making agroforestry an important component of Moriori subsistence.

TI US exposure to multiple landscape stressors and climate change
SO REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
AB We examined landscape exposure to wildfire potential, insects and disease risk, and urban and exurban development for the conterminous US (CONUS). Our analysis relied on spatial data used by federal agencies to evaluate these stressors nationally. We combined stressor data with a climate change exposure metric to identify when temperature is likely to depart from historical conditions and become "unprecedented." We used a neighborhood analysis procedure based on key stressor thresholds within a geographic information system to examine the extent of landscape exposure to our set of individual and coinciding stressors. Our focus is on identifying large contiguous areas of stress exposure which would be of national concern to identify potential locations most vulnerable to resulting ecological and social disruption. The arrival of record-setting temperatures may be both rapid and widespread within the CONUS under RCP8.5. By 2060, 91 % of the CONUS could depart from the climate of the last century. While much of the CONUS may be impacted by at least one of the landscape stressors we examined, multiple coinciding stressors occurred for less than 9 % of the CONUS. The two most prevalent coinciding stressors were (1) wildfire potential combined with insects and disease risk, and (2) climate departure combined with urban and exurban development. Combined exposure to three or more stressors was rare, but we did identify several localized high-population areas that may be vulnerable to future change. Additional assessment and research for these areas may provide early and proactive approaches to mitigating multiple stressor exposure.

TI Earth science data records of global forest cover and change: Assessment
   of accuracy in 1990, 2000, and 2005 epochs
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
AB The Global Land Cover Facility (GLCF) global forest-cover and -change dataset is a multi-temporal depiction of long-term (multi-decadal), global forest dynamics at high (30-m) resolution. Based on per-pixel estimates of percentage tree cover and their associated uncertainty, the dataset currently represents binary forest cover in nominal 1990, 2000, and 2005 epochs, as well as gains and losses over time. A comprehensive accuracy assessment of the GLCF dataset was performed using a global, design-based sample of 27,988 independent, visually interpreted reference points collected through a two-stage, stratified sampling design wherein experts visually identified forest cover and change in each of the 3 epochs based on Landsat and high-resolution satellite images, vegetation index profiles, and field photos. Consistent across epochs, the overall accuracy of the static forest-cover layers was 91%, and the overall accuracy of forest-cover change was >88% among the highest accuracies reported for recent global forest- and land-cover data products. Both commission error (CE) and omission error (OE) were low for static forest cover in each epoch and for the stable classes between epochs (CE < 3%, OE < 22%), but errors were larger for forest loss (45% <= CE < 62%, 47% < OE < 55%) and gain (66% <= CE < 85%, 61% < OE < 84%). Accuracy was lower in sparse forests and savannahs, i.e., where tree cover was at or near the 30% threshold used to discriminate forest from non-forest cover. Discrimination of forest had a low rate of commission error and slight negative bias, especially in areas with low tree cover. After adjusting global area estimates to reference data, 39.28 +/- 1.34 million km(2) and 38.81 +/- 1.34 million km(2) of forest were respectively identified in 2000 and 2005 globally, and 33.16 +/- 1.36 million km(2) of forest were estimated in the available coverage of Landsat data circa-1990. Forest loss and gain were estimated to have been 0.73 +/- 0.38 and 0.28 +/- 0.26 million km(2) between 2000 and 2005, and 1.08 +/- 0.53 and 0.53 +/- 0.47 million km(2) between 1990 and 2000. These estimates of accuracy are required for rigorous use of the data in the Earth sciences (e.g., ecology, economics, hydrology, climatology) as well as for fusion with other records of global change.

TI Forest aboveground biomass mapping and estimation across multiple
   spatial scales using model-based inference
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
AB Remotely sensed data have been widely used in recent years for mapping and estimating biomass. However, the characterization of the uncertainty of mapped or estimated biomass in previous studies was either based on ad-hoc approaches (e.g., using model fitting statistics such root mean square errors derived from purposive samples) or mostly limited to the analysis of mean biomass for the whole study area. This study proposed a novel uncertainty analysis method that can characterize biomass uncertainty across multiple spatial scales and multiple spatial resolutions. The uncertainty analysis method built on model-based inference and can propagate errors from trees to field plots, individual pixels, and small areas or large regions that consist of multiple pixels (up to all pixels within a study area). We developed and tested this method over northern Minnesota forest areas of approximately 69,508 km(2) via a unique combination of several datasets for biomass mapping and estimation: wall-to-wall airborne lidar data, national forest inventory (NFI) plots, and destructive measurements of tree aboveground biomass (AGB). We found that the pixel-level AGB prediction error is dominated by lidar-based AGB model residual errors when the spatial resolution is near 380 m or finer and by model parameter estimate errors when the spatial resolution is coarser. We also found that the relative error of AGB predicted from lidar can be reduced to approximately 11% (or mean 5.1 Mg/ha; max 43.6 Mg/ha) at one-hectare scale (or at 100 m spatial resolution) over our study area. Because our uncertainty analysis method uses model-based inference and does not require probability samples of field plots, our methodology has potential applications worldwide, especially over tropics and developing countries where NFI systems are not well-established.

TI Great expectations: An analysis of major league baseball free agent
   performance
SO STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND DATA MINING
AB We explore whether free agents in Major League Baseball meet the expectations set forth by newly signed contracts. The value and duration of these contracts are negotiated between the player (and his agent) and the signing team and are based primarily on the player's performance to date, projected future performance, and potential marketing value to the team. We develop two classes of models to explore this problem using a variety of regression- and tree-based machine learning algorithms. The market model uses player and team data to predict the market value of a player's performance (i.e., average contract salary). The performance model uses the same data to predict wins above replacement as a surrogate for overall player performance. We translate this measure into dollars using position-based conversion factors. Analysis of these models demonstrates that the performance model more consistently predicts and assesses player value with respect to their free agent contracts. Together, these models can be used to target or avoid free agents (or other players) whose performance-based value differs significantly from their market value. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB We study the volatility of the output of a Boolean function when the input bits undergo a natural dynamics. For n = 1, 2,..., let f(n) : {0, 1}(mn) -> {0, 1} be a Boolean function and X-(n)(t) = (Xi (t),..., X-mn (t))(t) (is an element of) ([0, infinity)) be a vector of i.i.d. stationary continuous time Markov chains on {0, 1} that jump from 0 to 1 with rate p(n) is an element of [0, 1] and from 1 to 0 with rate q(n) = 1 p(n). Our object of study will be Cn which is the number of state changes of f(n)(X-(n)(t)) as a function oft during [0, 1]. We say that the family {f(n)}(n >= 1) is volatile if Cn -> infinity in distribution as n -> infinity and say that {f(n)}(n >= 1) is tame if {Cn}(n >= 1) is tight. We study these concepts in and of themselves as well as investigate their relationship with the recent notions of noise sensitivity and noise stability. In addition, we study the question of lameness which means that P(C-n = 0) -> 1 as n -> infinity . Finally, we investigate these properties for the majority function, iterated 3-majority, the AND/OR function on the binary tree and percolation on certain trees in various regimes.

TI Sibling species in the Chrysis ignita complex: molecular, morphological
   and trophic differentiation of Baltic species, with a description of two
   new cryptic species (Hymenoptera: Chrysididae)
SO SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY
AB Cryptic species complexes cause major challenges for taxonomists and alter understanding of species diversity. In Northern Europe, the Chrysis ignita species group is one such complex with numerous sympatric sibling species. The objective of this paper is to assess the taxonomy of 15 species from this group using three different approaches: molecular, morphological and trophic differentiation. The analysed set of molecular markers included a 7400-bp-long sequence of the mitochondrial genome covering complete sequences of CO1, CO2, ATP8, ATP6, CO3, ND3, 16S and 12S rRNA, nine tRNAs and a partial sequence of CytB, as well as a 3880-bp-long sequence of the nuclear DNA covering a part of 18S rRNA, the ITS1, 5.8S rRNA, ITS2 and a part of 28S rRNA. Discrete diagnostic characters of each species sequence were retrieved using the Characteristic Attribute Organisation System algorithm and a molecular identification key was compiled. The study revealed a higher evolutionary rate of the genes ATP8, ATP6, CO3, ND3 and CytB compared to that of CO1, CO2 and 16S; the studied nuclear markers demonstrated a lower evolutionary rate than the mitochondrial markers. A consensus tree compiled based on the combined mtDNA and nuclear markers with a strongly supported topology resolved the position of the C.schencki-C. parietissp.n. clade as sister to the C.ignita-C.impressa clade and supported the monophyly of the C.angustula-C.longula clade. We compiled a morphometric species identification key applying linear discriminant equations. The trophic differentiation was assessed using data on host preferences of ten Chrysis species reared from trap-nests; the analysis demonstrated that most of them are specialists exploiting a single or a few taxonomically related host species. In most cases, all three approaches supported the distinct status of the included species. Moreover, two previously undescribed species were consistently supported by the molecular methods. Therefore, we describe these as new, namely C.horridulasp.n. and C.parietissp.n. Only C.mediata and C.solida were not clearly distinguished using the molecular phylogeny reconstruction methods. However, based on distinctive niche divergence, the presence of molecular characters and morphometric differences, we consider them as phylogenetically young but distinct species. In view of the weak morphological and molecular differentiation, the widely overlapping distribution areas and often similar habitat preferences and the trophic specialization, the C.ignita complex presents a possible model for studies of sympatric cryptic speciation.

TI Exploring myrmecophily based on the phylogenetic interrelationships of
   Falagonia Sharp, 1883 (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae: Aleocharinae) and
   allied genera
SO SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY
AB The taxonomy of Lomechusini Fleming has a complex history. Recent studies have shown that this group is polyphyletic; however, little is known about the evolutionary interrelationships among its constituent genera. The goals of the present study are to infer the phylogenetic relationships of FalagoniaSharp and closely related genera; to define the boundaries of those genera based on synapomorphic characters; and to explore the evolution of myrmecophily within the lineage. The phylogenetic analyses are based exclusively on morphological characters of adults. A total of 36 operational taxonomic units were used for the analysis. The best trees were selected based on maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference. During the parsimony reconstruction, different weighting strategies were used to recover the most robust phylogenetic hypothesis. Although minor differences were observed in the results of the different analyses, the topologies were consistent throughout. Several groups of genera proposed by Seevers (1965), such as the Tetradonia' and Ecitopora' groups, were not recovered. Thus, these may represent nonmonophyletic groups that were based on nonsynapomorphic diagnostic characters. Our analyses consistently recovered the genera AsheidiumSantiago-Jimenez, DelgadoidiumSantiago-Jimenez, Falagonia, NewtonidiumSantiago-Jimenez, PseudofalagoniaSantiago-Jimenez, SharpidiumSantiago-Jimenez, TetradoniaWasmann and ThayeridiumSantiago-Jimenez, forming a monophyletic group that we have called the Asheidium complex'. Falagonia mexicanaSharp shows seven autapomorphies, none of which were used to establish the genus. Based on the phylogenetic results, myrmecophily has evolved independently at least three times within the lineage. This study, based on morphological characters, is one of the first approaches towards gaining an understanding of the phylogenetic relationships within the polyphyletic tribe Lomechusini.

Three fossil beetles recorded from Inner Mongolia, China (Callovian, Middle Jurassic, approximately 165Ma) are assigned to Cleridae and constitute the earliest known representatives of this family. Two of the fossils are described as Protoclerus korynetoidesgen. et sp.n. and the third as Wangweiella callovianagen. et sp.n. Ninety-six morphological characters of the larvae and adults of 17 extant clerid representatives and seven cleroid families as outgroups were analysed under maximum parsimony with, and without, fossil species included in the matrix. The results indicate that Protoclerusgen.n. is a separate lineage within the family, whereas Wangweiellagen.n. is sister to the rest of Epiclininae. The resulting trees are compared with the most recent morphological and molecular phylogenies of Cleridae. The trees presented appear congruent with the latest molecular phylogenies. The evolution of Cleridae, as well as their biogeography and systematics, are briefly reviewed. A complete list of clerid fossil species described to date is provided.

TI Phylogeny of the subfamily Larentiinae (Lepidoptera: Geometridae):
   integrating molecular data and traditional classifications
SO SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY
AB Larentiinae are the second largest subfamily of Geometridae, with more than 6200 described species. Despite recent advances in molecular systematics of geometrid moths, phylogenetic relationships between the numerous subgroups of Larentiinae are poorly known. In this study we present the most comprehensive attempt to date to resolve the phylogeny of Larentiinae, having sampled at least one species from all currently recognized 23 tribes. Fragments of one mitochondrial (COI) and eight nuclear (EF-1, WGL, GAPDH, RPS5, IDH, MDH, CAD and 28S) genes were sequenced, for a total of 6939 bp. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses resulted in identical well-resolved phylogenetic trees, which had maximum or near-maximum support values at most nodes. Almost all conventionally recognized tribes represented by more than one genus were found to be monophyletic. Close to the root of Larentiinae, six tribes branch off the main lineage one after another, with Dyspteridini being sister to all other members of the subfamily. The rest of larentiines are divided into two very diverse lineages, comprising eight and at least ten tribes, respectively. There were just three findings incongruent with the conventional tribal subdivision of the subfamily. First, the genera CollixGuenee and AnticollixProut formed a separate, previously unrecognized but well-supported clade at the tribe level. Second, the Palaearctic genus PelurgaHubner was placed apart from LarentiaTreitschke and MesoleucaHubner, which were the other members of Larentiini in this analysis. Third, Cataclysmini appeared together with genera belonging to Xanthorhoini, leaving the latter paraphyletic. The Neotropic genus OligopleuraHerrich-Schaffer is shown to belong to the tribe Euphyiini (comb.n.) according to both molecular data and male genital morphology. The results and the tribal classification of Larentiinae are discussed with reference to the principal publications since the end of the 19th Century. We conclude that the current tribal classification of Larentiinae is not controversial from the phylogenetic point of view and that its increasing complexity has merely reflected the accumulation of information, mainly through different methods of biosystematic study having become available for researchers. Our results indicate that diurnal lifestyle, accompanied by conspicuous coloration, has evolved independently in several subgroups of Larentiinae.

TI Putting Parasemia in its phylogenetic place: a molecular analysis of the
   subtribe Arctiina (Lepidoptera)
SO SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY
AB Despite being popular among amateur and professional lepidopterologists and posing great opportunities for evolutionary research, the phylogenetic relationships of tiger moths (Erebidae: Arctiinae) are not well resolved. Here we provide the first phylogenetic hypothesis for the subtribe Arctiina with the basic aim of clarifying the phylogenetic position of the Wood Tiger Moth Parasemia plantaginis Hubner, a model species in evolutionary ecology. We sampled 89 species in 52 genera within Arctiina s.l., 11 species of Callimorphina and two outgroup species. We sequenced up to seven nuclear genes (CAD, GAPDH, IDH, MDH, Ef1, RpS5, Wingless) and one mitochondrial gene (COI) including the barcode region (a total of 5915 bp). Both maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference resulted in a well-resolved phylogenetic hypothesis, consisting of four clades within Arctiina s.s. and a clade comprising spilosomine species in addition to Callimorphina and outgroups. Based on our results, we present a new classification, where we consider the Diacrisia clade, Chelis clade, Apantesis clade, Micrarctia Seitz and Arctia clade as valid genera within Arctiina s.s., whereas Rhyparia Hubner syn.n. and Rhyparioides Butler syn.n. are synonymized with Diacrisia Hubner; Neoarctia Neumoegen & Dyar syn.n., Tancrea Pungeler syn.n., Hyperborea Grum-Grshimailo syn.n., Palearctia Ferguson syn.n., Holoarctia Ferguson syn.n., Sibirarctia Dubatolov syn.n. and Centrarctia Dubatolov syn.n. are synonymized with Chelis Rambur; Grammia Rambur syn.n., Orodemnias Wallengren syn.n., Mimarctia Neumoegen & Dyar syn.n., Notarctia Smith syn.n. and Holarctia Smith syn.n. are synonymized with Apantesis Walker; and Epicallia Hubner syn.n., Eucharia Hubner syn.n., Hyphoraia Hubner syn.n., Parasemia Hubner syn.n., Pericallia Hubner syn.n., Nemeophila Stephens syn.n., Ammobiota Wallengren syn.n., Platarctia Packard syn.n., Chionophila Guenee syn.n., Eupsychoma Grote syn.n., Gonerda Moore syn.n., Platyprepia Dyar syn.n., Preparctia Hampson syn.n., Oroncus Seitz syn.n., Acerbia Sotavalta syn.n., Pararctia Sotavalta syn.n., Borearctia Dubatolov syn.n., Sinoarctia Dubatolov syn.n. and Atlantarctia Dubatolov syn.n. are synonymized with Arctia Schrank, leading to 33 new genus-level synonymies. Our focal species Arctia plantaginiscomb.n. is placed as sister to Arctia festivacomb.n., another widespread aposematic species showing wing pattern variation. Our molecular hypothesis can be used as a basis when adding more species to the tree and tackling interesting evolutionary questions, such as the evolution of warning signalling and mimicry in tiger moths.

TI Consensus of classification trees for skin sensitisation hazard
   prediction
SO TOXICOLOGY IN VITRO
AB Since March 2013, it is no longer possible to market in the European Union (EU) cosmetics containing new ingredients tested on animals. Although several in silico alternatives are available and achievements have been made in the development and regulatory adoption of skin sensitisation non-animal tests, there is not yet a generally accepted approach for skin sensitisation assessment that would fully substitute the need for animal testing.
   The aim of this work was to build a defined approach (i.e. a predictive model based on readouts from various information sources that uses a fixed procedure for generating a prediction) for skin sensitisation hazard prediction (sensitiser/non-sensitiser) using Local Lymph Node Assay (LLNA) results as reference classifications. To derive the model, we built a dataset with high quality data from in chemico (DPRA) and in vitro (KeratinoSens (TM) and h-CLAT) methods, and it was complemented with predictions from several software packages.
   The modelling exercise showed that skin sensitisation hazard was better predicted by classification trees based on in silico predictions.
   The defined approach consists of a consensus of two classification trees that are based on descriptors that account for protein reactivity and structural features. The model showed an accuracy of 0.93, sensitivity of 0.98, and specificity of 0.85 for 269 chemicals. In addition, the defined approach provides a measure of confidence associated to the prediction.

TI Severe dry winter affects plant phenology and carbon balance of a cork
   oak woodland understorey
SO ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB Mediterranean climates are prone to a great variation in yearly precipitation. The effects on ecosystem will depend on the severity and timing of droughts. In this study we questioned how an extreme dry winter affects the carbon flux in the understorey of a cork oak woodland? What is the seasonal contribution of understorey vegetation to ecosystem productivity?
   We used closed-system portable chambers to measure CO2 exchange of the dominant shrub species (Cistus salviifolius, Cistus crispus and Ulex airensis), of the herbaceous layer and on bare soil in a cork oak woodland in central Portugal during the dry winter year of 2012. Shoot growth, leaf shedding, flower and fruit setting, above and belowground plant biomass were measured as well as seasonal leaf water potential. Eddy-covariance and micrometeorological data together with CO2 exchange measurements were used to access the understorey species contribution to ecosystem gross primary productivity (GPP).
   The herbaceous layer productivity was severely affected by the dry winter, with half of the yearly maximum aboveground biomass in comparison with the 6 years site average: The semi-deciduous and evergreen shrubs showed desynchronized phenophases and lagged carbon uptake maxima. Whereas shallow-root shrubs exhibited opportunistic characteristics inexploiting the understorey light and water resources, deep rooted shrubs showed better water status but considerably lower assimilation rates. The contribution of understorey vegetation to ecosystem GPP was lower during summer with 14% and maximum during late spring, concomitantly with the lowest tree productivity due to tree canopy renewal. The herbaceous vegetation contribution to ecosystem GPP never exceeded 6% during this dry year stressing its sensitivity to winter and spring precipitation.
   Although shrubs are more resilient to precipitation variability when compared with the herbaceous vegetation, the contribution of the understorey vegetation to ecosystem GPP can be quite variable and will ultimately depend of tree density and canopy cover.

TI Nutrient dynamics and plant assemblages of Macrotermes falciger mounds
   in a savanna ecosystem
SO ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB Termites through mound construction and foraging activities contribute significantly to carbon and nutrient fluxes in nutrient-poor savannas. Despite this recognition, studies on the influence of termite mounds on carbon and nitrogen dynamics in sub-tropical savannas are limited. In this regard, we examined soil nutrient concentrations, organic carbon and nitrogen mineralization in incubation experiments in mounds of Macrotermes falciger and surrounding soils of sub-tropical savanna, northeast Zimbabwe. We also addressed whether termite mounds altered the plant community and if effects were similar across functional groups i.e. grasses, forbs or woody plants. Mound soils had significantly higher silt and clay content, pH and concentrations of calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), organic carbon (C), ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-) than surrounding soils, with marginal differences in phosphorus (P) and sodium (Na) between mounds and matrix soils. Nutrient enrichment increased by a factor ranging from 1.5 for C, 4.9 for Mg up to 10.3 for Ca. Although C mineralization, nitrification and nitrification fraction were similar between mounds and matrix soils, nitrogen mineralization was elevated on mounds relative to surrounding matrix soils. As a result, termite mounds supported unique plant communities rich and abundant in woody species but less diverse in grasses and forbs than the surrounding savanna matrix in response to mound-induced shifts in soil parameters specifically increased clay content, drainage and water availability, nutrient status and base cation (mainly Ca, Mg and Na) concentration. In conclusion, by altering soil properties such as texture, moisture content and nutrient status, termite mounds can alter the structure and composition of sub-tropical savanna plant communities, and these results are consistent with findings in other savanna systems suggesting that increase in soil clay content, nutrient status and associated changes in the plant community assemblage may be a general property of mound building termites.

TI The important role of scattered trees on the herbaceous diversity of a
   grazed Mediterranean dehesa
SO ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB Scattered trees are considered keystone structures and play an important role in Mediterranean sylvopastoral systems. Such systems are associated with high biodiversity and provide important natural resources and ecosystem services. In this study, we measured the contribution of scattered trees and different grazing management (cattle, sheep and wildlife only) to the diversity of the grassland sward in a dehesa (open holm oak woodland) located in Central Spain. We analyzed alpha and beta diversity through measurement of species richness, Shannon-Wiener, and Whittaker indices, respectively; and the floristic composition of the herb layer using subplots within two adjacent plots (trees present vs. trees absent) under three different grazing management regimes, including wildlife only, during a year. We found a 20-30% increment in the alpha diversity of wooded plots, compared to those without trees, regardless of grazing management. All beta indices calculated showed more than 60% species turnover. Wooded plots were occupied by different herbaceous species in different heterogeneous microsites (under the canopy, in the ecotone or on open land) created by the trees. Livestock grazing modified species composition (e.g. more nitrophilous species) compared to wildlife only plots. In addition to all their other benefits, trees are important to maintaining grassland diversity in Mediterranean dehesas. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI Robust least squares twin support vector machine for human activity
   recognition
SO APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING
AB Human activity recognition is an active area of research in Computer Vision. One of the challenges of activity recognition system is the presence of noise between related activity classes along with high training and testing time complexity of the system. In this paper, we address these problems by introducing a Robust Least Squares Twin Support Vector Machine (RLS-TWSVM) algorithm. RLS-TWSVM handles the heteroscedastic noise and outliers present in activity recognition framework. Incremental RLS-TWSVM is proposed to speed up the training phase. Further, we introduce the hierarchical approach with RLS-TWSVM to deal with multi-category activity recognition problem. Computational comparisons of our proposed approach on four well-known activity recognition datasets along with real world machine learning benchmark datasets have been carried out. Experimental results show that our method is not only fast but, yields significantly better generalization performance and is robust in order to handle heteroscedastic noise and outliers.

TI Self-correcting ensemble using a latent consensus model
SO APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING
AB Ensemble is a widely used technique to improve the predictive performance of a learning method by using several competing expert systems. In this study, we propose a new ensemble combination scheme using a latent consensus function that relates each predictor to the other. The proposed method is designed to adapt and self-correct weights even when a number of expert systems malfunction and become corrupted. To compare the performance of the proposed method with existing methods, experiments are performed on simulated data with corrupted outputs as well as on real-world data sets. Results show that the proposed method is effective and it improves the predictive performance even when a number of individual classifiers are malfunctioning. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI Evolving flexible beta basis function neural tree using extended genetic
   programming & Hybrid Artificial Bee Colony
SO APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING
AB In this paper, a new hybrid learning algorithm is introduced to evolve the flexible beta basis function neural tree (FBBFNT). The structure is developed using the Extended Genetic Programming (EGP) and the Beta parameters and connected weights are optimized by the Hybrid Artificial Bee Colony algorithm. This hybridization is essentially based on replacing the random Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) position with the guided Opposite -based Particle Swarm Optimization (OPSO) position. Such modification can minimize the delay which might be lead by the random position, in reaching the global solution. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated for benchmark problems drawn from time series prediction area and is compared with those of related methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI Sphingomonas hankyongensis sp nov isolated from tap water
SO ARCHIVES OF MICROBIOLOGY
AB A Gram reaction-negative, strictly aerobic, non-motile, translucent and rod-shaped bacterium (designated W1-2-4(T)) isolated from tap water was characterized by a polyphasic approach to clarify its taxonomic position. Strain W1-2-4(T) was observed to grow optimally at 25-30 A degrees C and at pH 6.5 on nutrient agar. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain W1-2-4(T) belongs to the genus Sphingomonas and is most closely related to the Sphingomonas fennica K101(T) (95.3 % similarity). The G+C content of genomic DNA was 67.1 mol%. Chemotaxonomic data [major ubiquinone-Q-10, major polyamine-homospermidine, major fatty acids-summed feature 8 (comprising C-18:1 omega 7c/omega 6c), C-16:0 and C-14:0 2OH] supported the affiliation of strain W1-2-4(T) to the genus Sphingomonas. Strain W1-2-4(T) could be differentiated genotypically and phenotypically from the recognized species of the genus Sphingomonas. The novel isolate therefore represents a novel species, for which the name Sphingomonas hankyongensis sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain W1-2-4(T) (=KACC 18308(T) = LMG 28595(T)).

   fastidiosa strains reveal the occurrence of three subspecies and a new

SO ARCHIVES OF MICROBIOLOGY
AB A total of 21 Xylella fastidiosa strains were assessed by comparing their genomes to infer their taxonomic relationships. The whole-genome-based average nucleotide identity and tetranucleotide frequency correlation coefficient analyses were performed. In addition, a consensus tree based on comparisons of 956 core gene families, and a genome-wide phylogenetic tree and a Neighbor-net network were constructed with 820,088 nucleotides (i.e., approximately 30-33 % of the entire X. fastidiosa genome). All approaches revealed the occurrence of three well-demarcated genetic clusters that represent X. fastidiosa subspecies fastidiosa, multiplex and pauca, with the latter appeared to diverge. We suggest that the proposed but never formally described subspecies 'sandyi' and 'morus' are instead members of the subspecies fastidiosa. These analyses support the view that the Xylella strain isolated from Pyrus pyrifolia in Taiwan is likely to be a new species. A widely used multilocus sequence typing analysis yielded conflicting results.

TI Identification of "Bacillus cellulasensis" strain NIO-1130(T) as a
   member of Bacillus altitudinis and emendation of the latter
SO ARCHIVES OF MICROBIOLOGY
AB In the study by Mawlankar et al. in Arch Microbiol 198:83-89 (2016), the phylogenetic position of strain "Bacillus cellulasensis" NIO-1130(T) based on 16S rRNA and gyrB genes was inconsistent. Therefore, the aim of this study is to re-determine its taxonomic status using diverse genotypic approaches including single gene analysis, multilocus sequence analysis, and genomic analyses. The reconstructed phylogenetic trees based on 16S rRNA gene and six concatenated genes showed that "B. cellulasensis" NIO-1130(T) (=NCIM 5461(T) = CCTCC AB 2011126(T)) revealed the closest genetic relationship with type strain Bacillus altitudinis 41KF2b(T), with 98.6-100 % similarities of 16S rRNA gene, gyrB, pycA, pyrE, mutL, aroE, trpB, and six concatenated housekeeping genes. The high similarities for gene(s) sequences between "B. cellulasensis" NIO-1130(T) and B. altitudinis 41KF2b(T) indicated that they should be conspecific. The DNA G+C content for strain NIO-1130(T) was determined to be 41.3 mol% and identical to that of B. altitudinis 41KF2b(T). Moreover, 88.4 % of digital DNA-DNA hybridization and 98.7 % of average nucleotide identity values between two strains were much higher than the standard criteria for delineation of bacterial species, suggesting that they belonged to the same species. Therefore, the data from the combined genotypic analyses suggest that "Bacillus cellulasensis" should be classified as a member of Bacillus altitudinis.

TI Building knowledge maps of Web graphs

AB We research the problem of building knowledge maps of graph-like information. There exist well-consolidated cartographic principles and techniques for mapping physical landscapes. However, we live in the digital era and similarly to the Earth, the Web is simply too large and its interrelations too complex for anyone to grasp much of it through direct observation. Thus, the problem of applying cartographic principles also to digital landscapes is intriguing. We introduce a mathematical formalism that captures the general notion of map of a graph and enables its development and manipulation in a semi automated way. We present an implementation of our formalism on the Web of Linked Data graph and discuss algorithms that efficiently generate and combine (via an algebra) regions and maps. We present the MaGe tool, implementing the map framework, and discuss examples of knowledge maps. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Interactive inspection of complex multi-object industrial assemblies
SO COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN
AB The use of virtual prototypes and digital models containing thousands of individual objects is commonplace in complex industrial applications like the cooperative design of huge ships. Designers are interested in selecting and editing specific sets of objects during the interactive inspection sessions. This is however not supported by standard visualization systems for huge models. In this paper we discuss in detail the concept of rendering front in multiresolution trees, their properties and the algorithms that construct the hierarchy and efficiently render it, applied to very complex CAD models, so that the model structure and the identities of objects are preserved. We also propose an algorithm for the interactive inspection of huge models which uses a rendering budget and supports selection of individual objects and sets of objects, displacement of the selected objects and real-time collision detection during these displacements. Our solution based on the analysis of several existing view-dependent visualization schemes uses a Hybrid Multiresolution Tree that mixes layers of exact geometry, simplified models and impostors, together with a time-critical, view-dependent algorithm and a Constrained Front. The algorithm has been successfully tested in real industrial environments; the models involved are presented and discussed in the paper. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI ngrays: Distinct gravitational interactions in GADGET-2
SO COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB We discuss an extension of the massively parallel cosmological simulation code GADGET-2, which now enables investigation of multiple and distinct gravitational force laws, provided they are dominated by a constant scaling of the Newtonian force. In addition to simplifying investigations of a universally modified force law, the ngrays extension provides a foundation for state-of-the-art collisionless cosmological simulations of exotic gravitational scenarios. We briefly review the algorithms used by GADGET-2, and present our extension to multiple gravities, highlighting additional features that facilitate consideration of exotic force laws. We discuss the accuracy and performance of the ngrays extension, both internally and with an unaltered GADGET-2, in the relevant operational modes. The ngrays extension is publicly released to the research community.

   Nature of problem:
   N-body cosmological codes are traditionally designed to investigate a single gravitating species interacting via the Newtonian force law. There exist viable extensions to General Relativity [1], however, which predict weakfield, slow-motion limits featuring distinct gravitational force laws between distinct particle species. To enable investigation and constraint of these theories with available astrophysical data, a necessary first step is to extend an N-body simulator to handle distinct gravitating species.
   Solution method:
   The massively parallel Barnes Hut tree, Fast Fourier Transform, and sorting routines of the versatile and well-vetted N-body simulator [2] gadget-2 were extended to support D distinct gravitationally interacting species. The tree implementation now vectorizes over each species' monopole masses and positions, the Fourier routines now handle active and passive gravitational masses separately, and the sorting routines now group all particle data by type. An additional file was introduced allowing the user to specify all D-2 gravitational interactions: real space, Fourier space, and lattice summation corrections. To improve monopole approximations in scenarios where the scale of the gravitational interaction depends on the mass itself, an optional tracking of the number of bodies contributing to any particular monopole approximation has been written.
   Restrictions:
   Force laws with mass-dependent scale lengths are not amenable to the implemented Fourier methods (or even the traditional [3] Fourier approach). Nodes containing highly heterogeneous collections of particles with different mass-dependent scale lengths may not be well-approximated, even with the additional tracking introduced. The collisional "gas" species can only interact via a single gravitational force law.
   Unusual features:
   The extension allows consideration of quite general and exotic interactions between bodies, and will serve as a common platform for model-dependent adjustments to the cosmological background evolution.
   Additional comments:
   Data file format is identical to that of gadget-2. Configuration file format is unchanged, save for the addition of required bindings between particle species and gravitational type.
   Running time:
   Typical running times are <= 2Dx those of gadget-2, where D is an integer between 1 and 6.

TI Treatment of Metastatic Prostate Cancer in Older Adults
SO CURRENT ONCOLOGY REPORTS
AB The aging of the population, along with rising life expectancy, means that increasing numbers of older men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer, and a large proportion of these men will present with metastatic disease. In this paper, we discuss recent advances in prostate cancer treatment. In particular, we review management approaches for older patients with metastatic prostate cancer based on the decision tree developed by the International Society of Geriatric Oncology, which categorized older men as "fit," "vulnerable," and "frail" according to comprehensive geriatric assessment.

TI Pollen- and charcoal-based evidence for climatic and human impact on
   vegetation in the northern edge of Wuyi Mountains, China, during the
   last 8200 years
SO HOLOCENE
AB Pollen and charcoal records derived from the sediment core of Lantianyan (LTY) peat bog, Northern Wuyi Mountain chains, eastern subtropical China, provide valuable information of landscape evolution caused by both climatic variation and anthropogenic activities over the past 8200years. Our results reveal fluvial and lacustrine deposition between c. 8200 and 5600 cal. yr BP. The high proportion of pollen from evergreen broadleaved forests (e.g. Quercus and Castanopsis) and Alnus trees, a taxon frequently occurring in mountain wetlands, implies a humid interval, which is consistent with the Holocene moisture maximum in eastern China. After 5600 cal. yr BP, the spread of the wooded swamp taxon, Glyptostrobus, suggests shallow water conditions and peat formation caused by gradual drying. The drying trend generally corresponds with the speleothem isotope record from this region, revealing a weakening East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) due to a decrease in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation (and in air temperature). Peaks in the abundance and concentration of Glyptostrobus pollen at c. 4600-4400 cal. yr BP and c. 3300-3000 cal. yr BP suggest two periods of swamp expansions, which coincide with the drought intervals revealed by the speleothem records. The LTY pollen and charcoal record demonstrates that human-induced land cover change was negligible before 3600 cal. yr BP. We consider the first signal of intensive human activity and landscape clearing to be the noticeable increase in charcoal particles at around 3600 cal. yr BP. This anthropogenic impact is followed by a dramatic decrease in arboreal pollen and increase in Poaceae pollen percentages, likely reflecting a transition to rice-paddy agriculture in the study area.

TI Palaeobotanical records from Rebun Island and their potential for
   improving the chronological control and understanding human-environment
   interactions in the Hokkaido Region, Japan
SO HOLOCENE
AB Rebun Island with Hamanaka and Funadomari among the 43 documented archaeological sites and the environmental archive stored in the Lake Kushu sediment proves to be one of the key areas to study the interplay between ecology, climate and human activities. This paper focuses on the potential of palaeobotanical records from Rebun Island for improving the chronological control and understanding of late Quaternary climate changes and habitation environments of northern hunter-gatherers in the Hokkaido Region of Japan. A set of 57 radiocarbon dates of the RK12 core (Lake Kushu) demonstrates that it represents a continuous environmental archive covering the last c. 17,000years. The RK12 pollen record reflects distinct vegetation changes associated with the onset of the lateglacial warming about 15,000 cal. yr BP and the cold climate reversal after c. 13,000 cal. yr BP. The onset of the current Holocene interglacial after c. 11,700 cal. yr BP is marked by a major spread of trees. The middle Holocene (c. 8000-4000 cal. yr BP) is characterized by a major spread of deciduous oak in the vegetation cover reflecting a temperature increase. A decline of oak and spread of fir and pine is recorded at c. 2000 cal. yr BP. After c. 1100 cal. yr BP, arboreal pollen percentages decrease, possibly linked to intensified usage of wood during the Okhotsk and Ainu culture periods. The results of diatom analysis suggest marshy or deltaic environments at the RK12 coring site prior to c. 10,500 cal. yr BP and a brackish lagoon between c. 10,500 and 7000 cal. yr BP. A freshwater lake developed after 6500 cal. yr BP, likely reflecting sea level stabilization and formation of the sand bar separating the Kushu depression from the sea. Plant macrofossil analysis shows use of various wild plants and also domesticated barley during the Okhotsk and Ainu periods.

TI Development and evaluation of species distribution models for five
   endangered elasmobranchs in southwestern Atlantic
SO HYDROBIOLOGIA
AB Species distribution models (SDMs) are tools to obtain habitat suitability maps based on historical species occurrences and environmental variables. Those maps can be used to restrict fishing grounds or to assist in planning and reserve selection. This is especially important for species at risk of extinction. We developed SDMs for five endangered elasmobranch species, namely Squatina guggenheim, S. occulta, Rhinobatos horkelii, Galeorhinus galeus, and Mustelus schmitti, using Boosted Regression Trees. Data from 1,704 bottom trawls carried out between 1972 and 2005 as part of research surveys on the southern Brazilian shelf between 28A degrees 36'S and 33A degrees 45'S, combined with satellite imagery and environmental atlases, were used in the models. Based on 10-fold cross-validation statistics, all models had a reasonable performance, though S. guggenheim models had an excellent discrimination (AUC > 0.9) and R. horkelii models had just a fair discriminatory power (AUC 0.7-0.8). Except for R. horkelii, all models showed good association between observed and predicted occurrences (PBC > 0.5). Squatina guggenheim models provided the greatest explained deviance (49-54%), whereas R. horkelii models the smallest (14-17%). Models' predictions were consistent with the current knowledge of all species. Moreover, those models made reasonable predictions using the great spatial and temporal coverage of satellite data.

TI Coniferous needle litter acts as a stable food resource for stream
   detritivores
SO HYDROBIOLOGIA
AB We investigated the diets of stream detritivores in a coniferous plantation and a deciduous-coniferous mixed forest using stable isotope (delta C-13 and delta N-15) mixing models. In summer, collector-gatherers (Ephemera japonica, McLachlan, and Paralichas sp.) and a shredder (Lepidostoma crassicorne, Ulmer) utilized coniferous needle litter but not broad-leaved deciduous litter as their food resource because coniferous litter was persistent and remained on the streambed in both the forests even in summer. In early spring, L. crassicorne in the mixed forest utilized both coniferous needle litter and broad-leaved deciduous litter because both were abundant and available. However, coniferous needle litter was the only dominant food source available for the shredder species in the plantation where deciduous trees were less abundant. E. japonica and a collector-filterer (Hydropsyche sp.) in the forest possibly utilized fine materials derived from coniferous needle litter but not those derived from broad-leaved deciduous litter as their food resource. Although previous studies have indicated that coniferous needle litter is less nutritious than broad-leaved deciduous litter, persistence of the coniferous needle litter provides a stable basal food resource for shredders, collector-gatherers, and collector-filterers in forested streams that receive litter inputs from neighboring conifers.

TI Extractable Common Randomness From Gaussian Trees: Topological and
   Algebraic Perspectives
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY
AB In this paper, we study both topological and algebraic properties of unrooted Gaussian trees in order to characterize their security performance. Such performance is measured by the corresponding potential in extracting common randomness from a given tree, which is further determined by max-min and min-max conditional mutual information (CMI) values, subject to the order of selecting variables from the tree by legitimate nodes Alice and Bob, and an eavesdropper Eve, respectively. A new operation is proposed to transform a Gaussian tree into another, and also to order different Gaussian trees. Through such operation we construct several equivalent classes of Gaussian trees. Each class includes multiple Gaussian trees that can be partially ordered based on the associated max-min or min-max CMI metric, and thus, we can find the most secure and the least secure trees in each partially ordered set (poset). The union of all posets generates all possible non-isomorphic trees of the given number of variables. Then, we assign a particular polynomial to each Gaussian tree, and show that such polynomial can determine the relative security performance of the Gaussian tree with respect to other trees within the same class. In the end, based on a generalized integer partition method, we propose a novel approach to efficiently enumerate the most secure structures of all posets.

TI Eye tracking evaluation of visual analytics
SO INFORMATION VISUALIZATION
AB The application of eye tracking for the evaluation of humans' viewing behavior is a common approach in psychological research. So far, the use of this technique for the evaluation of visual analytics and visualization is less prominent. We investigate recent scientific publications from the main visualization and visual analytics conferences and journals, as well as related research fields that include an evaluation by eye tracking. Furthermore, we provide an overview of evaluation goals that can be achieved by eye tracking and state-of-the-art analysis techniques for eye tracking data. Ideally, visual analytics leads to a mixed-initiative cognitive system where the mechanism of distribution is the interaction of the user with the visualization environment. Therefore, we also include a discussion of cognitive approaches and models to include the user in the evaluation process. Based on our review of the current use of eye tracking evaluation in our field and the cognitive theory, we propose directions for future research on evaluation methodology, leading to the grand challenge of developing an evaluation approach to the mixed-initiative cognitive system of visual analytics.

TI The effect of topographic normalization on fractional tree cover mapping
   in tropical mountains: An assessment based on seasonal Landsat time
   series
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
AB Free archive of georectified and atmospherically corrected Landsat satellite images create a large range of opportunities for environmental research. However, the topographic effects in images are typically normalized regionally by end-users, and it remains uncertain if this procedure is always necessary. Our objective was to assess the effect of topographic normalization on the fractional tree cover (Fcover) modelling in a tropical mountain landscape, in Southeastern Kenya. We carried out topographic normalization by C-correction for all available Landsat images between June 2012 and October 2013, and examined if normalization improves Fcover regressions. The reference Fcover was based on airborne LiDAR data. Furthermore, we tested several vegetation indices and seasonal features (annual percentiles and means), and compared three digital elevation models (DEM). Our results showed that the fit of Fcover models did not improve after topographic normalization in the case of ratio-based vegetation indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI; Reduced Simple Ratio, RSR) or Tasseled Cap Greenness but improved in the case of Brightness and Wetness, particularly in the period of the lowest sun elevation. RSR was the best vegetation index to predict Fcover. Furthermore, SRTM DEM provided stronger relationship with cosine of the solar incidence angle than ASTER DEM and regional DEM based on topographic maps. We conclude that NDVI and RSR are robust against topographic effects in the tropical mountain landscapes throughout the year. However, if Tasseled Cap indices are preferred, we recommend topographic normalization using SRTM DEM. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery performs better than optical
   datasets at retrieving woody fractional cover in deciduous, dry
   savannahs
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
AB Woody canopy cover (CC) is the simplest two dimensional metric for assessing the presence of the woody component in savannahs, but detailed validated maps are not currently available in southern African savannahs. A number of international EO programs (including in savannah landscapes) advocate and use optical LandSAT imagery for regional to country-wide mapping of woody canopy cover. However, previous research has shown that L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) provides good performance at retrieving woody canopy cover in southern African savannahs. This study's objective was to evaluate, compare and use in combination L-band ALOS PALSAR and LandSAT-5 TM, in a Random Forest environment, to assess the benefits of using LandSAT compared to ALOS PALSAR. Additional objectives saw the testing of LandSAT-5 image seasonality, spectral vegetation indices and image textures for improved CC modelling. Results showed that LandSAT-5 imagery acquired in the summer and autumn seasons yielded the highest single season modelling accuracies (R-2 between 0.47 and 0.65), depending on the year but the combination of multi-seasonal images yielded higher accuracies (R-2 between 0.57 and 0.72). The derivation of spectral vegetation indices and image textures and their combinations with optical reflectance bands provided minimal improvement with no optical-only result exceeding the winter SAR L-band backscatter alone results (R-2 of similar to 0.8). The integration of seasonally appropriate LandSAT-5 image reflectance and L-band HH and HV backscatter data does provide a significant improvement for CC modelling at the higher end of the model performance (R-2 between 0.83 and 0.88), but we conclude that L-band only based CC modelling be recommended for South African regions.

TI Individual tree crown delineation using localized contour tree method
   and airborne LiDAR data in coniferous forests
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
AB Individual tree crown delineation is of great importance for forest inventory and management. The increasing availability of high-resolution airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data makes it possible to delineate the crown structure of individual trees and deduce their geometric properties with high accuracy. In this study, we developed an automated segmentation method that is able to fully utilize high-resolution LiDAR data for detecting, extracting, and characterizing individual tree crowns with a multitude of geometric and topological properties. The proposed approach captures topological structure of forest and quantifies topological relationships of tree crowns by using a graph theory-based localized contour tree method, and finally segments individual tree crowns by analogy of recognizing hills from a topographic map. This approach consists of five key technical components: (1) derivation of canopy height model from airborne LiDAR data; (2) generation of contours based on the canopy height model; (3) extraction of hierarchical structures of tree crowns using the localized contour tree method; (4) delineation of individual tree crowns by segmenting hierarchical crown structure; and (5) calculation of geometric and topological properties of individual trees. We applied our new method to the Medicine Bow National Forest in the southwest of Laramie, Wyoming and the HJ Andrews Experimental Forest in the central portion of the Cascade Range of Oregon, U.S. The results reveal that the overall accuracy of individual tree crown delineation for the two study areas achieved 94.21% and 75.07%, respectively. Our method holds great potential for segmenting individual tree crowns under various forest conditions. Furthermore, the geometric and topological attributes derived from our method provide comprehensive and essential information for forest management. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Generating spike-free digital surface models using LiDAR raw point
   clouds: A new approach for forestry applications
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
AB Accurately detecting single trees from LiDAR data requires generating a high-resolution Digital Surface Model (DSM) that faithfully represents the uppermost layer of the forest canopy. A high-resolution DSM raster is commonly generated by interpolating all first LiDAR returns through a Delaunay TIN. The first return 2D surface interpolation struggles to produce a faithful representation of the canopy when there are first returns that have very similar x-y coordinates but very different z values. When triangulated together into a TIN, such constellations will form needle-shaped triangles that appear as spikes that geometrically disrupt the DSM and negatively affect treetop detection and subsequent extraction of biophysical parameters. We introduce a spike-free algorithm that considers all returns (e.g. also second and third returns) and systematically prevents spikes formation during TIN construction by ignoring any return whose insertion would result in a spike. Our algorithm takes a raw point cloud (i.e., unclassified) as input and produces a spike-free TIN as output that is then rasterized onto a corresponding pit-free DSM grid. We evaluate the new algorithm by comparing the results of treetop detection using the pit-free DSM with those achieved using a common first-return DSM. The results show that our algorithm significantly improves the accuracy of treetop detection, especially for small trees. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Timber production assessment of a plantation forest: An integrated
   framework with field-based inventory, multi-source remote sensing data
   and forest management history
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
AB Timber production is the purpose for managing plantation forests, and its spatial and quantitative information is critical for advising management strategies. Previous studies have focused on growing stock volume (GSV), which represents the current potential of timber production, yet few studies have investigated historical process-harvested timber. This resulted in a gap in a synthetical ecosystem service assessment of timber production. In this paper, we established a Management Process-based Timber production (MPT) framework to integrate the current GSV and the harvested timber derived from historical logging regimes, trying to synthetically assess timber production for a historical period. In the MPT framework, age-class and current GSV determine the times of historical thinning and the corresponding harvested timber, by using a "space-for-time" substitution. The total timber production can be estimated by the historical harvested timber in each thinning and the current GSV. To test this MPT framework, an empirical study on a larch plantation (LP) with area of 43,946 ha was conducted in North China for a period from 1962 to 2010. Field-based inventory data was integrated with ALOS PALSAR (Advanced Land-Observing Satellite Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) and Landsat-8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) data for estimating the age-class and current GSV of LP. The random forest model with PALSAR backscatter intensity channels and OLI bands as input predictive variables yielded an accuracy of 67.9% with a Kappa coefficient of 0.59 for age-class classification. The regression model using PALSAR data produced a root mean square error (RMSE) of 36.5 m(3) ha(-1). The total timber production of LP was estimated to be 7.27 x 10(6) m(3), with 4.87 x 10(6) m(3) in current GSV and 2.40 x 10(6) m(3) in harvested timber through historical thinning. The historical process-harvested timber accounts to 33.0% of the total timber production, which component has been neglected in the assessments for current status of plantation forests. Synthetically considering the RMSE for predictive GSV and misclassification of age-class, the error in timber production were supposed to range from -55.2 to 56.3 m(3) ha(-1). The MPT framework can be used to assess timber production of other tree species at a larger spatial scale, providing crucial information for a better understanding of forest ecosystem service.

TI Obtaining biophysical measurements of woody vegetation from high
   resolution digital aerial photography in tropical and arid environments:
   Northern Territory, Australia
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
AB Biophysical parameters obtained from woody vegetation are commonly measured using field based techniques which require significant investment in resources. Quantitative measurements of woody vegetation provide important information for ecological studies investigating landscape change. The fine spatial resolution of aerial photography enables identification of features such as trees and shrubs. Improvements in spatial and spectral resolution of digital aerial photographic sensors have increased the possibility of using these data in quantitative remote sensing. Obtaining biophysical measurements from aerial photography has the potential to enable it to be used as a surrogate for the collection of field data. In this study quantitative measurements obtained from digital aerial photography captured at ground sampling distance (GSD) of 15 cm (n = 50) and 30 cm (n = 52) were compared to woody biophysical parameters measured from 1 ha field plots. Supervised classification of the aerial photography using object based image analysis was used to quantify woody and non-woody vegetation components in the imagery. There was a high correlation (r >= 0.92) between all field measured woody canopy parameters and aerial derived green woody cover measurements, however only foliage projective cover (FPC) was found to be statistically significant (paired t-test; alpha=0.01). There was no significant difference between measurements derived from imagery captured at either GSD of 15 cm and 30 cm over the same field site (n = 20). Live stand basal area (SBA) (m(2) ha(-1)) was predicted from the aerial photographs by applying an allometric equation developed between field-measured live SBA and woody FPC. The results show that there was very little difference between live SBA predicted from FPC measured in the field or from aerial photography. The results of this study show that accurate woody biophysical parameters can be obtained from aerial photography from a range of woody vegetation communities across the Northern Territory.

TI Estimation of regeneration coverage in a temperate forest by 3D
   segmentation using airborne laser scanning data
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
AB Forest understory and regeneration are important factors in sustainable forest management. However, understanding their spatial distribution in multilayered forests requires accurate and continuously updated field data, which are difficult and time-consuming to obtain. Therefore, cost-efficient inventory methods are required, and airborne laser scanning (ALS) is a promising tool for obtaining such information. In this study, we examine a clustering-based 3D segmentation in combination with ALS data for regeneration coverage estimation in a multilayered temperate forest. The core of our method is a two tiered segmentation of the 3D point clouds into segments associated with regeneration trees. First, small parts of trees (super-voxels) are constructed through mean shift clustering, a nonparametric procedure for finding the local maxima of a density function. In the second step, we form a graph based on the mean shift clusters and merge them into larger segments using the normalized cut algorithm. These segments are used to obtain regeneration coverage of the target plot. Results show that, based on validation data from field inventory and terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), our approach correctly estimates up to 70% of regeneration coverage across the plots with different properties, such as tree height and tree species. The proposed method is negatively impacted by the density of the overstory because of decreasing ground point density. In addition, the estimated coverage has a strong relationship with the overstory tree species composition. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI A multiple-point spatially weighted k-NN method for object-based
   classification
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
AB Object-based classification, commonly referred to as object-based image analysis (OBIA), is now commonly regarded as able to produce more appealing classification maps, often of greater accuracy, than pixel-based classification and its application is now widespread. Therefore, improvement of OBIA using spatial techniques is of great interest. In this paper, multiple-point statistics (MPS) is proposed for object-based classification enhancement in the form of a new multiple-point k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) classification method (MPk-NN). The proposed method first utilises a training image derived from a pre-classified map to characterise the spatial correlation between multiple points of land cover classes. The MPS borrows spatial structures from other parts of the training image, and then incorporates this spatial information, in the form of multiple-point probabilities, into the k-NN classifier. Two satellite sensor images with a fine spatial resolution were selected to evaluate the new method. One is an IKONOS image of the Beijing urban area and the other is a WorldView-2 image of the Wolong mountainous area, in China. The images were object-based classified using the MPk-NN method and several alternatives, including the k-NN, the geostatistically weighted k-NN, the Bayesian method, the decision tree classifier (DTC), and the support vector machine classifier (SVM). It was demonstrated that the new spatial weighting based on MPS can achieve greater classification accuracy relative to the alternatives and it is, thus, recommended as appropriate for object-based classification.

TI The relationship between satellite-derived indices and species diversity
   across African savanna ecosystems
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
AB The ability to use remotely sensed diversity is important for the management of ecosystems at large spatial extents. However, to achieve this, there is still need to develop robust methods and approaches that enable large-scale mapping of species diversity. In this study, we tested the relationship between species diversity measured in situ with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Coefficient of Variation in the NDVI (CVNDVI) derived from high and medium spatial resolution satellite data at dry, wet and coastal savanna woodlands. We further tested the effect of logging on NDVI along the transects and between transects as disturbance may be a mechanism driving the patterns observed. Overall, the results of this study suggest that high tree species diversity is associated with low and high NDVI and at intermediate levels is associated with low tree species diversity and NDVI. High tree species diversity is associated with high CVNDVI and vice versa and at intermediate levels is associated with high tree species diversity and CVNDVI. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI Effect of flying altitude, scanning angle and scanning mode on the
   accuracy of ALS based forest inventory
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
AB Airborne laser scanning (ALS) is a widely used technology in the mapping of environment and forests. Data acquisition costs and the accuracy of the forest inventory are closely dependent on some extrinsic parameters of the ALS survey. These parameters have been assessed in numerous studies about a decade ago, but since then ALS devices have developed and it is possible that previous findings do not hold true with newer technology. That is why, the effect of flying altitudes (2000, 2500 or 3000 m), scanning angles (+/- 15 degrees and +/- 20 degrees off nadir) and scanning modes (single- and multiple pulses in air) with the area-based approach using a Leica ALS70HA-laser scanner was studied here. The study was conducted in a managed pine-dominated forest area in Finland, where eight separate discrete-return ALS data were acquired. The comparison of datasets was based on the bootstrap approach with 5-fold cross validation. Results indicated that the narrower scanning angle (+/- 15 degrees i.e. 30 degrees) led to slightly more accurate estimates of plot volume (RMSE%: 21-24 vs. 22.5-25) and mean height (RMSE%: 8.5-11 vs. 9-12). We also tested the use case where the models are constructed using one data and then applied to other data gathered with different parameters. The most accurate models were identified using the bootstrap approach and applied to different datasets with and without refitting. The bias increased without refitting the models (bias%: volume 0 +/- 10, mean height 0 +/- 3), but in most cases the results did not differ much in terms of RMSE%. This confirms previous observations that models should only be used for datasets collected under similar data acquisition conditions. We also calculated the proportions of echoes as a function of height for different echo categories. This indicated that the accuracy of the inventory is affected more by the height distribution than the proportions of echo categories. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Above ground biomass and tree species richness estimation with airborne
   lidar in tropical Ghana forests
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
AB Estimates of forest aboveground biomass are fundamental for carbon monitoring and accounting; delivering information at very high spatial resolution is especially valuable for local management, conservation and selective logging purposes. In tropical areas, hosting large biomass and biodiversity resources which are often threatened by unsustainable anthropogenic pressures, frequent forest resources monitoring is needed. Lidar is a powerful tool to estimate aboveground biomass at fine resolution; however its application in tropical forests has been limited, with high variability in the accuracy of results. Lidar pulses scan the forest vertical profile, and can provide structure information which is also linked to biodiversity. In the last decade the remote sensing of biodiversity has received great attention, but few studies focused on the use of lidar for assessing tree species richness in tropical forests.
   This research aims at estimating aboveground,biomass and tree species richness using discrete return airborne lidar in Ghana forests. We tested an advanced statistical technique, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), which does not require assumptions on data distribution or on the relationships between variables, being suitable for studying ecological variables.
   We compared the MARS regression results with those obtained by multilinear regression and found that both algorithms were effective, but MARS provided higher accuracy either for biomass (R-2 = 0.72) and species richness (R-2 = 0.64). We also noted strong correlation between biodiversity and biomass field values. Even if the forest areas under analysis are limited in extent and represent peculiar ecosystems, the preliminary indications produced by our study suggest that instrument such as lidar, specifically useful for pinpointing forest structure, can also be exploited as a support for tree species richness assessment.

TI Enhancing the performance of regional land cover mapping
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
AB Different pixel-based, object-based and subpixel-based methods such as time-series analysis, decision tree, and different supervised approaches have been proposed to conduct land use/cover classification. However, despite their proven advantages in small dataset tests, their performance is variable and less satisfactory while dealing with large datasets, particularly, for regional-scale mapping with high resolution data due to the complexity and diversity in landscapes and land cover patterns, and the unacceptably long processing time. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the comparatively highest performance of an operational approach based on integration of multisource information ensuring high mapping accuracy in large areas with acceptable processing time. The information used includes phenologically contrasted multiseasonal and multispectral bands, vegetation index, land surface temperature, and topographic features. The performance of different conventional and machine learning classifiers namely Malahanobis Distance (MD), Maximum Likelihood (ML), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Random Forests (RFs) was compared using the same datasets in the same IDL (Interactive Data Language) environment. An Eastern Mediterranean area with complex landscape and steep climate gradients was selected to test and develop the operational approach. The results showed that SVMs and RFs classifiers produced most accurate mapping at local-scale (up to 96.85% in Overall Accuracy), but were very time-consuming in whole-scene classification (more than five days per scene) whereas ML fulfilled the task rapidly (about 10 min per scene) with satisfying accuracy (94.2-96.4%). Thus, the approach composed of integration of seasonally contrasted multisource data and sampling at subclass level followed by a ML classification is a suitable candidate to become an operational and effective regional land cover mapping method.

TI The use of airborne hyperspectral data for tree species classification
   in a species-rich Central European forest area
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
AB The success of remote sensing approaches to assess tree species diversity in a heterogeneously mixed forest stand depends on the availability of both appropriate data and suitable classification algorithms. To separate the high number of in total ten broadleaf tree species in a small structured floodplain forest, the Leipzig Riverside Forest, we introduce a majority based classification approach for Discriminant Analysis based on Partial Least Squares (PLS-DA), which was tested against Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The classifier performance was tested on different sets of airborne hyperspectral image data (AISA DUAL) that were acquired on single dates in August and September and also stacked to a composite product. Shadowed gaps and shadowed crown parts were eliminated via spectral mixture analysis (SMA) prior to the pixel-based classification. Training and validation sets were defined spectrally with the conditioned Latin hypercube method as a stratified random sampling procedure. In the validation, PIS-DA consistently outperformed the RF and SVM approaches on all datasets. The additional use of spectral variable selection (CARS, "competitive adaptive reweighted sampling") combined with PLS-DA further improved classification accuracies. Up to 78.4% overall accuracy was achieved for the stacked dataset. The image recorded in August provided slightly higher accuracies than the September image, regardless of the applied classifier.

TI Analysis of the pattern of potential woody cover in Texas savanna
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
AB While woody plant encroachment has been observed worldwide in savannas and adversely affected the ecosystem structure and function, a thorough understanding of the nature of this phenomenon is urgently required for savanna management and restoration. Among others, potential woody cover (the maximum realizable woody cover that a given site can support), especially its variation over environment has huge implication on the encroachment management in particular, and on tree-grass interactions in general. This prpject was designed to explore the pattern of potential woody cover in Texas savanna, an ecosystem with a large rainfall gradient in west east direction. Substantial random pixels were sampled across the study area from MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) tree cover layer (250 m). Since potential woody cover is suggested to be limited by water availability, a nonlinear 99th quantile regression was performed between the observed woody cover and mean annual precipitation (MAP) to model the pattern of potential woody cover. Research result suggests a segmented relationship between potential woody cover and MAP at MODIS scale. Potential biases as well as the practical and theoretical implications were discussed. Through this study, the hypothesis about the primary role of water availability in determining savanna woody cover was further confirmed in a relatively understudied US-located savanna.

TI A robust approach for tree segmentation in deciduous forests using
   small-footprint airborne LiDAR data
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
AB This paper presents a non-parametric approach for segmenting trees from airborne LiDAR data in deciduous forests. Based on the LiDAR point cloud, the approach collects crown information such as steepness and height on-the-fly to delineate crown boundaries, and most importantly, does not require a priori assumptions of crown shape and size. The approach segments trees iteratively starting from the tallest within a given area to the smallest until all trees have been segmented. To evaluate its performance, the approach was applied to the University of Kentucky Robinson Forest, a deciduous closed-canopy forest with complex terrain and vegetation conditions. The approach identified 94% of dominant and co-dominant trees with a false detection rate of 13%. About 62% of intermediate, overtopped, and dead trees were also detected with a false detection rate of 15%. The overall segmentation accuracy was 77%. Correlations of the segmentation scores of the proposed approach with local terrain and stand metrics was not significant, which is likely an indication of the robustness of the approach as results are not sensitive to the differences in terrain and stand structures.

TI Electrospun fibers based on Arabic, karaya and kondagogu gums
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES
AB Nanofibers of natural tree polysaccharides based on three gums namely Arabic (GA), karaya (GK) and kondagogu (KG) have been prepared for the first time using electrospinning. Electrospinning solutions were prepared by mixing gum solutions of GA, GK & KG with eco-friendly polymers such as polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) or polyethylene oxide (PEO). The present study focuses on the effect of electrospinning blended solutions of GA, GK or KG with PVA or PEO, additives which influence system parameters and process parameters. This has important effects on the electrospinning process and the resulting fibers whose morphology and physicochemical properties were evaluated. The mass ratios of 70:30 to 90:10 for PVA: GA, PVA: GK and PVA: KG were observed to establish an optimum blend solution ratio in order to fabricate uniform beadless nanofibers with an average diameter of 240 +/- 50, 220 +/- 40 and 210 +/- 30 nm, respectively. Various structural and physicochemical properties of the electrospun fibers were investigated. Furthermore, the comparisons of various functionalities of the untreated and plasma treated electrospun fibers were assessed. The methane plasma treated nanofibers were shown to be of extremely specific surface area, improved water contact angle, high surface porosity and roughness and superior hydrophobic properties compared to untreated fibers.

TI A two-stage stochastic programming model for lot-sizing and scheduling
   under uncertainty
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS
AB A lot-sizing and scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setups is addressed in this paper. In the production system, manufactories receive raw materials from upstream sites, and after production, the final products are shipped to downstream sites and customers. The key is to find a good production planning so that their cost is minimized. A two-stage stochastic programming model is formulated to minimize the total production, inventory and backorder costs. The first stage decides the baseline production including the production quantity of each product and the sequence of production while the second stage focuses on the possible updates of baseline production such as overtime production. The goal is to find the best sequence of production quantities under random demand with backorders allowed. Uncertainty is explicitly represented with a scenario tree then selecting the most representative scenarios in order to obtain a smaller subset while preserving essential properties. Both setup time and setup cost are product dependent. A case study for a manufacturing company producing braking equipment has been conducted to illustrate and validate the model. The results show that the stochastic model outperforms the deterministic model, especially when there are sufficient production resources. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the domination game, two players, the Dominator and Staller, take turns adding vertices of a fixed graph to a set, at each turn increasing the number of vertices dominated by the set, until the final set dominates the whole graph. The Dominator plays to minimise the size of the set while the Staller plays to maximise it. A graph is -trivial if when the Dominator plays first and both players play optimally, the set is a minimum dominating set of the graph. A graph is -trivial if the same is true when the Staller plays first. We consider the problem of characterising -trivial and -trivial graphs. We give complete characterisations of -trivial forests and of -trivial forests. We also show that -connected -trivial graphs cannot have large girth, and conjecture that the same holds without the connectivity condition.

This problem is called the inverse 1-center problem on trees. We focus on the problem under Chebyshev norm and Hamming distance. From special properties of the objective functions, we can develop combinatorial algorithms to solve the problem. Precisely, if there does not exist any vertex coinciding with the prespecified vertex during the modification of edge lengths, the problem under Chebyshev norm or bottleneck Hamming distance is solvable in time, where is the number of vertices of the tree. Dropping this condition, the problem can be solved in time.

TI Parallel level-set methods on adaptive tree-based grids
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS
AB We present scalable algorithms for the level-set method on dynamic, adaptive Quadtree and Octree Cartesian grids. The algorithms are fully parallelized and implemented using the MPI standard and the open-source p4est library. We solve the level set equation with a semi-Lagrangian method which, similar to its serial implementation, is free of any time-step restrictions. This is achieved by introducing a scalable global interpolation scheme on adaptive tree-based grids. Moreover, we present a simple parallel reinitialization scheme using the pseudo-time transient formulation. Both parallel algorithms scale on the Stampede supercomputer, where we are currently using up to 4096 CPU cores, the limit of our current account. Finally, a relevant application of the algorithms is presented in modeling a crystallization phenomenon by solving a Stefan problem, illustrating a level of detail that would be impossible to achieve without a parallel adaptive strategy. We believe that the algorithms presented in this article will be of interest and useful to researchers working with the level-set framework and modeling multi-scale physics in general.

TI Models of reforestation productivity and carbon sequestration for land
   use and climate change adaptation planning in South Australia
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Environmental management and regional land use planning has become more complex in recent years as growing world population, climate change, carbon markets and government policies for sustainability have emerged. Reforestation and agroforestry options for environmental benefits, carbon sequestration, economic development and biodiversity conservation are now important considerations of land use planners. New information has been collected and regionally-calibrated models have been developed to facilitate better regional land use planning decisions and counter the limitations of currently available models of reforestation productivity and carbon sequestration. Surveys of above-ground biomass of 264 reforestation sites (132 woodlots, 132 environmental plantings) within the agricultural regions of South Australia were conducted, and combined with spatial information on climate and soils, to develop new spatial and temporal models of plant density and above-ground biomass productivity from reforestation. The models can be used to estimate productivity and total carbon sequestration (i.e. aboveground + below-ground biomass) under a continuous range of planting designs (e.g. variable proportions of trees and shrubs or plant densities), timeframes and future climate scenarios. Representative spatial models (1 ha resolution) for 3 reforestation designs (i.e.,woodlots, typical environmental planting, biodiverse environmental plantings) x 3 timeframes (i.e. 25, 45, 65 years) x 4 possible climates (i.e. no change, mild, moderate, severe warming and drying) were generated (i.e. 36 scenarios) for use within land use planning tools.

TI Silvopastoral systems of the Chol Mayan ethnic group in southern Mexico:
   Strategies with a traditional basis
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Silvopastoral systems combine trees and/or shrubs with grazing cattle. In the municipality of Salto de Agua, Chiapas, Mexico, some indigenous communities have developed silvopastoral systems based on their traditional knowledge regarding use of local natural resources. Through analysis of classification based on the composition of tree vegetation, two groups of grazing units were identified in the study area. Different attributes of tree and herbaceous vegetation, as well as of agricultural management and production, were compared between the two groups. Results indicate that at least two strategies of silvopastoral management exist. The first - LTD - is characterized by an average density of 22 adult trees ha(-1) in grazing units with an average surface area of 22.4 ha. The second - HTD - has an average of 54.4 trees ha(-1) in grazing units with an average surface area of 12.2 ha. Average richness per grazing unit for the LTD strategy was 7.2 species, and for HTD strategy it was 12.7 species. Average basal area for LTD was 1.7 m(2) ha(-1), and for HTD 3.8 m(2) ha(-1). Finally, the average level of fixed carbon for LTD was 2.12 mg ha(-1), and for HTD 4.89 mg ha(-1). For all variables, there was a significant difference between the two strategies. In addition, both strategies differ in prairie management. In the HTD strategy, growers spare their preferred spontaneously growing tree species by clearing around them. Many of these species, particularly those harvested for timber, belong to the original vegetation. In these prairies, average coverage of native grasses (60.8 +/- 7.85) was significantly greater than in the LTD strategy (38.4 +/- 1132), and neither fertilizers nor fire are used to maintain or improve the pastures; by contrast, in HTD prairies, introduced grasses, principally Cynodon plectostachyus, have a higher average coverage (43.4 +/- 13.75) than in the LTD prairies (17.08 +/- 9.02). Regardless of the differences in composition of tree and herbaceous vegetation, in both types of grazing units a similar animal load is maintained.
   Many attributes of these silvopastoral strategies - based on traditional technology of the Chol farmers of the Tulija River Valley - concord with sustainable agriculture and provide a wide variety of services to the farmer and the environment. Diffusion of this technology in areas similar to that of this region could have a positive impact on the economy of conventional cattle raisers while generating environmental services.

TI The impact of biochars prepared from agricultural residues on phosphorus
   release and availability in two fertile soils
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Biochars have a high variability in chemical composition, which is influenced by pyrolysis conditions and type of biomass. Essential macronutrient P retained in biochar could be released and made available to plants, enhancing plant growth. This study was conducted in order to evaluate whether biochar, produced from agricultural residues, could release P in water, as well as study its potential effect on plant growth and P uptake. Biochar samples were prepared from rice husks, grape pomace and olive tree prunings by pyrolysis at 300 degrees C and 500 degrees C. These samples were used for P batch successive leaching experiments in order to determine P release in water. Subsequently, rice husk and grape pomace biochars, produced by pyrolysis at 300 degrees C, were applied to two temperate soils with highly different pH. A three-month cultivation period of ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) was studied in threefold replication, while three harvests were accomplished. Treatments comprised control soils (without amendment), and soils amended only with biochar. Results of P leaching tests showed a continuous release of P from all biochars as compared to raw biomass samples, for which the highest P concentrations were detected during the first extraction. Grape pomace and rice husk biochars pyrolyzed at 500 degrees C showed higher levels of water extractable P, as compared to their corresponding raw biomass. Biochars, at 500 degrees C, leached more P in all four extractions, compared to biochars at 300 degrees C, apart from olive tree prunings biochars,, where both pyrolysis temperatures presented a similar trend. Concerning plant yield of ryegrass, rice husk and grape pomace biochars showed positive statistically significant effects on plant yield only in slightly acidic soil in second and third harvests. In terms of P uptake of ryegrass, grape pomace biochars depicted positive significant differences (P < 0.05) in third harvest, in slightly acidic soil, while in first and second harvests positive significant differences were observed in alkaline soil. These results suggest that biochars derived from agricultural residues may act as a source of P in agronomic applications and improve plant growth, although soil conditions may play a significant role.

TI Pleistocene diversification and speciation of White-throated Thrush
   (Turdus assimilis; Aves: Turdidae)
SO JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY
AB It is suggested that dispersal and vicariance led to speciation in Mesoamerican taxa during the Pleistocene, as a consequence of climatic fluctuations and resulting range disjunctions, but few biogeographic studies have been developed to assess their relative roles. Based on a mitochondrial DNA dataset, we analyzed the evolutionary history of Turdus assimilis, a species distributed in Mesoamerica and northwestern South America. Phylogenetic patterns, divergence times, and biogeographic analyses suggest a South American ancestor for T. assimilis, which split from T. albicollis between 1.4 and 3.0 Ma ago. The analysis suggests the colonization of Mesoamerica and the Choc region by small numbers of founder individuals. Furthermore, genetic divergence, reciprocal monophyly, an ancient disjunction, and clear phenotypic differences suggest that the population from the Choc region, T. a. daguae, represents a separate species from T. assimilis.

TI Wood biomass characterization by DSC or FT-IR spectroscopy
SO JOURNAL OF THERMAL ANALYSIS AND CALORIMETRY
AB The wood biomass obtained from four tree species: spruce, beech, willow and alder was studied. Sawdust obtained by sawing of wood was dried in a convective dryer at 80 A degrees C, without drying-agent flow. The measurements taken with oven-drying method covered determination of initial moisture and its detailed changes during entire drying process. Both DSC curves and spectral data from infrared spectra registered in the classic MIR range were also used to monitor change in water content in studied samples within entire drying process. Results obtained suggest that the DSC curves can be efficiently used as a discriminant to distinguish dry and wet biomass samples, as significant differences within courses of specific DSC curves of woody biomass before and after drying process occurred. Calorimetrically measured values of enthalpy of evaporation of water and water content in studied biomass samples were directly proportional to high determination coefficient, i.e. 0.9653. Statistical analysis proved quantitative directly proportional correlation between content of water measured with oven-drying method and IR spectral data of studied samples.

TI Fast recommendation on latent collaborative relations
SO KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS
AB One important property of collaborative filtering recommender systems is that popular items are recommended disproportionately often because they provide extensive usage data and, thus, can be recommended to more users. Compared to popular products, the niches can be as economically attractive as mainstream fare for online retailers. The online retailers can stock virtually everything, and the number of available niche products exceeds the hits by several orders of magnitude. This work addresses accuracy, coverage and prediction time issues to propose a novel latent factor model called latent collaborative relations (LCR), which transforms the recommendation problem into a nearest neighbor search problem by using the proposed scoring function. We project users and items to the latent space, and calculate their similarities based on Euclidean metric. Additionally, the proposed model provides an elegant way to incorporate with locality sensitive hashing (LSH) to provide a fast recommendation while retaining recommendation accuracy and coverage. The experimental results indicate that the speedup is significant, especially when one is confronted with large-scale data sets. As for recommendation accuracy and coverage, the proposed method is competitive on three data sets. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Partial sequencing reveals the transposable element composition of
   Coffea genomes and provides evidence for distinct evolutionary stories
SO MOLECULAR GENETICS AND GENOMICS
AB The Coffea genus, 124 described species, has a natural distribution spreading from inter-tropical Africa, to Western Indian Ocean Islands, India, Asia and up to Australasia. Two cultivated species, C. arabica and C. canephora, are intensively studied while, the breeding potential and the genome composition of all the wild species remained poorly uncharacterized. Here, we report the characterization and comparison of the highly repeated transposable elements content of 11 Coffea species representatives of the natural biogeographic distribution. A total of 994 Mb from 454 reads were produced with a genome coverage ranging between 3.2 and 15.7 %. The analyses showed that highly repeated transposable elements, mainly LTR retrotransposons (LTR-RT), represent between 32 and 53 % of Coffea genomes depending on their biogeographic location and genome size. Species from West and Central Africa (Eucoffea) contained the highest LTR-RT content but with no strong variation relative to their genome size. At the opposite, for the insular species (Mascarocoffea), a strong variation of LTR-RT was observed suggesting differential dynamics of these elements in this group. Two LTR-RT lineages, SIRE and Del were clearly differentially accumulated between African and insular species, suggesting these lineages were associated to the genome divergence of Coffea species in Africa. Altogether, the information obtained in this study improves our knowledge and brings new data on the composition, the evolution and the divergence of wild Coffea genomes.

TI Carbonic Anhydrase 8 Expression in Purkinje Cells Is Controlled by PKC
   gamma Activity and Regulates Purkinje Cell Dendritic Growth
SO MOLECULAR NEUROBIOLOGY
AB Purkinje cell dendritic development is severely compromised after chronic activation of protein kinase C (PKC). In a recent transgenic mouse model of spinocerebellar ataxia 14, the ser361-to-gly (S361G) mutation of the protein kinase C gamma (PKC gamma) gene was expressed in Purkinje cells. Purkinje cells from these mutant mice in organotypic slice cultures have the same stunted dendritic tree as Purkinje cells after pharmacological activation of PKC. Because the transgene is exclusively present in Purkinje cells, cerebellar tissue from these mice is an attractive starting material for searching genes which might be interacting with PKC gamma in Purkinje cells for inducing the stunted dendritic growth. We have performed a microarray analysis and identified several candidate genes with an increased messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in the PKC gamma-S361G transgenic Purkinje cells. Out of these candidates, we have further studied carbonic anhydrase 8 (CA8). We show here that CA8 mRNA and protein expression is strongly induced in PKC gamma-S361G transgenic Purkinje cells. Overexpression of CA8 in Purkinje cells in dissociated cultures strongly inhibited Purkinje cell dendritic development and produced a dendritic phenotype similar to PKC gamma-S361G. There was no evidence for a direct binding of CA8 to either PKC gamma or the type 1 IP3 receptor. Knockdown of CA8 with miRNA did not alter Purkinje cell dendritic development and did not protect Purkinje cells in dissociated cultures from the stunted dendritic growth induced by PKC gamma-S361G or by PKC activation. Our results indicate that CA8 is a novel important regulator of Purkinje cell dendritic development and that its expression is controlled by PKC gamma activity.

TI Cryptic Diversity of Malassezia pachydermatis from Healthy and Diseased
   Domestic Animals
SO MYCOPATHOLOGIA
AB Malassezia pachydermatis is part of the normal cutaneous microbiota of wild and domestic carnivores. However, under certain conditions this yeast can overproliferate and cause several diseases in its host, mainly otitis and dermatitis in dogs. The aim of this study was to conduct a molecular characterization of M. pachydermatis isolates from healthy and diseased domestic animals, in order to assess the molecular diversity and phylogenetic relationship within this species. The large subunit (LSU) and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of ribosomal RNA, chitin synthase 2 (CHS2) and beta-tubulin genes from sixteen strains isolated from dogs, cats, a goat, a pig and a horse were sequenced. A different number of types of sequences were identified for each target gene, including some types described for the first time. Five sequence types were characterized for the LSU, eleven for the ITS region, nine for CHS2 and eight for beta-tubulin. A multilocus analysis was performed including the four genes, and the resulting phylogenetic tree revealed fifteen genotypes. Genotypes were distributed in two well-supported clades. One clade comprised strains isolated from different domestic animals and a strongly supported cluster constituted by strains isolated from cats. The second clade included strains isolated mainly from dogs and an outlier strain isolated from a horse. No apparent association could be observed between the health status of the animal hosts and concrete strains. The multilocus phylogenetic analysis is a useful tool to assess the intraspecific variation within this species and could help understand the ecology, epidemiology and speciation process of M. pachydermatis.

TI Heuristic techniques to optimize neural network architecture in
   manufacturing applications
SO NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
AB Nowadays application of neural networks in the manufacturing field is widely assessed even if this type of problem is typically characterized by an insufficient availability of data for a robust network training. Satisfactory results can be found in the literature, in both forming and machining operations, regarding the use of a neural network as a predictive tool. Nevertheless, the research of the optimal network configuration is still based on trial-and-error approaches, rather than on the application of specific techniques . As a consequence, the best method to determine the optimal neural network configuration is still a lack of knowledge in the literature overview. According to that, a comparative analysis is proposed in this work. More in detail four different approaches have been used to increase the generalization abilities of a neural network. These methods are based, respectively, on the use of genetic algorithms, Taguchi, tabu search and decision trees. The parameters taken into account in this work are the training algorithm, the number of hidden layers, the number of neurons and the activation function of each hidden layer. These techniques have been firstly tested on three different datasets, generated through numerical simulations in the Deform2D environment, in an attempt to map the input-output relationship for an extrusion, a rolling and a shearing process. Subsequently, the same approach has been validated on a fourth dataset derived from the literature review for a complex industrial process to widely generalize and asses the proposed methodology in the whole manufacturing field. Four tests were carried out for each dataset modifying the original data with a random noise with zero mean and standard deviation of one, two and five per cent. The results show that the use of a suitable technique for determining the architecture of a neural network can generate a significant performance improvement compared to a trial-and-error approach.

TI Taxonomic and ecological relevance of the chlorophyll a fluorescence
   signature of tree species in mixed European forests
SO NEW PHYTOLOGIST
AB The variability of chlorophyll a fluorescence (ChlF) parameters of forest tree species was investigated in 209 stands belonging to six European forests, from Mediterranean to boreal regions. The modifying role of environmental factors, forest structure and tree diversity (species richness and composition) on ChlF signature was analysed. At the European level, conifers showed higher potential performance than broadleaf species. Forests in central Europe performed better than those in Mediterranean and boreal regions. At the site level, homogeneous clusters of tree species were identified by means of a principal component analysis (PCA) of ChlF parameters. The discrimination of the clusters of species was influenced by their taxonomic position and ecological characteristics. The species richness influenced the tree ChlF properties in different ways depending on tree species and site. Tree species and site also affected the relationships between ChlF parameters and other plant functional traits (specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen content, light-saturated photosynthesis, wood density, leaf carbon isotope composition). The assessment of the photosynthetic properties of tree species, by means of ChlF parameters, in relation to their functional traits, is a relevant issue for studies in forest ecology. The connections of data from field surveys with remotely assessed parameters must be carefully explored.

TI Diversity in plant hydraulic traits explains seasonal and inter-annual
   variations of vegetation dynamics in seasonally dry tropical forests
SO NEW PHYTOLOGIST
AB We assessed whether diversity in plant hydraulic traits can explain the observed diversity in plant responses to water stress in seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTFs). The Ecosystem Demography model 2 (ED2) was updated with a trait-driven mechanistic plant hydraulic module, as well as novel drought-phenology and plant water stress schemes. Four plant functional types were parameterized on the basis of meta-analysis of plant hydraulic traits. Simulations from both the original and the updated ED2 were evaluated against 5yr of field data from a Costa Rican SDTF site and remote-sensing data over Central America. The updated model generated realistic plant hydraulic dynamics, such as leaf water potential and stem sap flow. Compared with the original ED2, predictions from our novel trait-driven model matched better with observed growth, phenology and their variations among functional groups. Most notably, the original ED2 produced unrealistically small leaf area index (LAI) and underestimated cumulative leaf litter. Both of these biases were corrected by the updated model. The updated model was also better able to simulate spatial patterns of LAI dynamics in Central America. Plant hydraulic traits are intercorrelated in SDTFs. Mechanistic incorporation of plant hydraulic traits is necessary for the simulation of spatiotemporal patterns of vegetation dynamics in SDTFs in vegetation models.

TI Too early and too northerly: evidence of temperate trees in northern
   Central Europe during the Younger Dryas
SO NEW PHYTOLOGIST
AB This paper presents highly unexpected paleobotanical data. Eight C-14-accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) dates of soil macrocharcoal pieces, identified taxonomically, indicate the presence of oak and beech in the Younger Dryas, and pine in the AllerOd, in the northernmost low mountain range of Central Europe, the Harz Mountains, in Germany. If the presence of pine at such latitude and periods is not surprising, the presence of temperate-adapted trees is highly improbable, because they are assumed to have reached the area from a southern location several thousand years later. Two hypotheses are postulated to explain this record. Both are related to the warm periods of the BOlling and AllerOd: the classically short' duration of this warm period makes the migration of the temperate trees from the identified refuge areas in the southern location implausible, and so the presence of intermediary microrefugia at a medium latitude in Central Europe is postulated; recent data reveal that the warm period of the Late Glacial phase was much longer than considered in the classical view and, thus, would be long enough for a northward migration of temperate-adapted trees. Although our dataset does not permit disentanglement of these hypotheses, it provides significant innovative insights for the biogeography of Central Europe.

TI Estimating Soil Salinity in the Yellow River Delta, Eastern China-An
   Integrated Approach Using Spectral and Terrain Indices with the
   Generalized Additive Model
SO PEDOSPHERE
AB Soil salinity is one of the most severe environmental problems worldwide. It is necessary to develop a soil-salinity-estimation model to project the spatial distribution of soil salinity. The aims of this study were to use remote sensed images and digital elevation model (DEM) to develop quantitative models for estimating soil salinity and to investigate the influence of vegetation on soil salinity estimation. Digital bands of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images, vegetation indices, and terrain indices were selected as predictive variables for the estimation. The generalized additive model (GAM) was used to analyze the quantitative relationship between soil salt content, spectral properties, and terrain indices. Akaike's information criterion (AIC) was used to select relevant predictive variables for fitted GAMs. A correlation analysis and root mean square error between predicted and observed soil salt contents were used to validate the fitted GAMs. A high ratio of explained deviance suggests that an integrated approach using spectral and terrain indices with GAM was practical and efficient for estimating soil salinity. The performance of the fitted GAMs varied with changes in vegetation cover. Salinity in sparsely vegetated areas was estimated better than in densely vegetated areas. Visible red and near-infrared bands, and the second and third components of the tasseled cap transformation were the most important spectral variables for the estimation. Variable combinations in the fitted GAMs and their contribution varied with changes in vegetation cover. The contribution of terrain indices was smaller than that of spectral indices, possibly due to the low spatial resolution of DEM. This research may provide some beneficial references for regional soil salinity estimation.

TI Mixing litter from deciduous and evergreen trees enhances decomposition
   in a subtropical karst forest in southwestern China
SO SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB In the karst region of southwestern China, mixed evergreen and deciduous broad-leaved forest is typical vegetation, differing remarkably from the evergreen broad-leaved forest developed in non-karst regions in the same latitudinal zone. Litter input from deciduous trees influences the characteristics of the litter layer, which could affect decomposition dynamics. We evaluated the role of deciduous trees in regulating the decomposition of mixed leaf litter in a karst forest. Four species richness treatments (one, two, four and six species) were designed to evaluate the decomposition rates of litter mixtures for two years. The ratio of deciduous to evergreen species numbers was 1:1 in all mixtures. Litter mass loss was positively correlated with initial nitrogen concentrations and negatively correlated with carbon:nitrogen ratios, suggesting that mass loss was controlled by nitrogen concentration of the litter mixture. Litter mixing accelerated the mass loss by 5.0% and enhanced nutrient release by 4.8%-26.2% for different elements. Synergistic effects in the four-species mixture were usually strongest and increased over time. Although individual litter species within the mixtures showed idiosyncratic responses to litter species richness, mixing effects enhanced decomposition of evergreen litter species more than deciduous species. This study suggests that species composition was more important than species richness in driving non additive effects on decomposition in this forest. Deciduous trees in karst ecosystems significantly contribute to nutrient cycling, through enhancing the decomposition of evergreen leaf litter. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Nitrogen dynamics within and between decomposing leaves, bark and
   branches in Eucalyptus planted forests
SO SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Nitrogen transfer between litter components is often presented as a key mechanism responsible for the synergistic effect of litter mixtures on decomposition rates. The litter cover is a heterogeneous environment stemming from the input of chemically distinct materials and the transfer of nutrients in this patchy environment is likely to fulfil the specific needs of microbial communities in each micro environment. Our study aimed to gain insight into the factors controlling N dynamics within and between leaves" and woody components in the litter cover. We used N-15 labelling to discriminate endogenous and exogenous N and to measure N transfers between three types of litter components, viz. leaves and twigs (L +T), bark and branches, in 162 litter bags for more than 2 years in two Congolese Eucalyptus forests with contrasting N status (low-N vs high-N litter). Large quantities of N were released from N-rich L + Tat the end of the study while early release of leachable N was only observed for the high-N L + T. Exogenous N was only incorporated in N-poor litter components (bark and branches) and a net increase in N compared to the initial quantities only occurred in the low-N bark. The bi-directional N transfers observed between litter components were most likely microbially-mediated rather than driven by abiotic leaching. Nitrogen transfers were controlled by the N status of both source and sink litter components, contrary to the diffusion theory based on concentration gradient. For a given source, more N was transferred to N-rich than to N-poor sink components. Our results suggested that the microbial community might control both the quantity of N available to be transferred to other microsites and the quantity that is actually transferred, presumably because the potential for N immobilization may be limited in N-poor litter components. Interactions among micro-environments can favor chemical convergence from distinct litter components to humified organic matter along the decay continuum. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Update: biological and chemical aspects of Nectandra genus (Lauraceae)
SO TETRAHEDRON-ASYMMETRY
AB The genus Nectandra, composed by approximately 120 species that are distributed in the tropical and subtropical regions of America, Africa, Asia, and Oceania, belongs to the Lauraceae family. Plants from this genus, usually trees, have been used in folk medicine as anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antifungal and antiprotozoal reagents; its biological potential has been reported in several studies conducted in vitro and in vivo. Chemically, the genus Nectandra contains different types of secondary metabolites, such as alkaloids (aporphine, proaporphine, benzylisoquinoline, bisbenzylisoquinoline, and morphinandienone) and lignoids (furofuran, benzofuran, tetrahydrofuran, dihydrofuran, and 3,3-neolignan). Other compounds, such as terpenoids (mainly mono and sesquiterpenes), steroids, phenylpropanoids and flavonoids have been described in Nectandra genus. Other minor derivatives such as coumarins, benzoic acid derivatives, xanthone, benzophenones, lactones, sugars and fatty acids have also been isolated. Most of these studies associate biological aspects to isolated compounds. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the chemistry of the genus Nectandra and compile approximately 200 compounds isolated from different species, together with their therapeutic potential.

TI Counting the Number of Perfect Matchings in K (5)-Free Graphs
SO THEORY OF COMPUTING SYSTEMS
AB Counting the number of perfect matchings in graphs is a computationally hard problem. However, in the case of planar graphs, and even for K (3,3)-free graphs, the number of perfect matchings can be computed efficiently. The technique to achieve this is to compute a Pfaffian orientation of a graph. In the case of K (5)-free graphs, this technique will not work because some K (5)-free graphs do not have a Pfaffian orientation. We circumvent this problem and show that the number of perfect matchings in K (5)-free graphs can be computed in polynomial time. We also parallelize the sequential algorithm and show that the problem is in TC2. We remark that our results generalize to graphs without singly-crossing minor.

TI On the Advice Complexity of the k-server Problem Under Sparse Metrics
SO THEORY OF COMPUTING SYSTEMS
AB We consider the k-Server problem under the advice model of computation when the underlying metric space is sparse. On one side, we introduce Iy(1)-competitive algorithms for a wide range of sparse graphs. These algorithms require advice of (almost) linear size. We show that for graphs of size N and treewidth alpha, there is an online algorithm that receives O (n(log alpha + log log N))(*) bits of advice and optimally serves any sequence of length n. We also prove that if a graph admits a system of mu collective tree (q, r)-spanners, then there is a (q + r)-competitive algorithm which requires O (n(log mu + log log N)) bits of advice. Among other results, this gives a 3-competitive algorithm for planar graphs, when provided with O (n log log N) bits of advice. On the other side, we prove that advice of size Omega(n) is required to obtain a 1-competitive algorithm for sequences of length n even for the 2-server problem on a path metric of size N aeyen 3. Through another lower bound argument, we show that at least bits of advice is required to obtain an optimal solution for metric spaces of treewidth alpha, where 4 aecurrency sign alpha < 2k.

TI Characterization of race 65 of Colletotrichum lindemuthianum by
   sequencing ITS regions
SO ACTA SCIENTIARUM-AGRONOMY
AB The present work aimed characterize isolates of C. lindemuthianum race 65 from different regions in Brazil by ITS sequencing. A total of 17 isolates of race 65, collected in the states of Mato Grosso, Minas Gerais, Parana, Santa Catarina and Sao Paulo, were studied. Analysis of the sequences of isolates 8, 9, 12, 14 and 15 revealed the presence of two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ITS1 region at the same positions. These isolates, when analyzed together with the sequence of isolate 17, revealed a SNP in the ITS2 region. The highest genetic dissimilarity, observed between isolates 11 and 3 and between isolates 11 and 10, was 0.772. In turn, isolates 7 and 2 were the most similar, with a value of 0.002 for genetic distance. The phylogenetic tree obtained based on the sequences of the ITS1 and ITS2 regions revealed the formation of two groups, one with a subgroup. The results reveal high molecular variability among isolates of race 65 of C. lindemuthianum.

TI Mangrove's response to cyclone Eline (2000): What is happening 14 years
   later
SO AQUATIC BOTANY
AB This study assesses the impact of severe cyclones on a mangrove forest and the response over a 14 year period. SPOT images from pre- and post-cyclone years were used to assess changes in area and in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in a cyclone impacted mangrove forest in central Mozambique. Forest structure and condition were evaluated in the field 11 years after the cyclone, sampling both the protected creek and exposed seaward mangroves. Transects perpendicular to the coast line were set across impact zones, covering high-, mid- and less-impacted zones. Quadrats (10 x 10 m) were set along each transect, and adult trees within were identified to species, Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) measured, height estimated, and life condition (living or dead) indicated. Regeneration was assessed in 5 x 5 m quadrats. Cyclone Eline impacted on 47.8% of the mangrove forest area, as shown by reduced NDVI in 2000 after the cyclone. Field sampling results indicate substantial recovery in creek forests; while seaward mangroves had 100% mortality in Rhizophora mucronata dominated areas. This species is sensitive to defoliation and sedimentation and unable to sprout. Only mid- and less-impacted zones had high densities of juveniles. Species with high regenerating success were R. mucronata, Ceriops tagal and Avicennia marina. Sheltered creek mangroves were able to recover but changes in sedimentation prevented recovery in the exposed seaward sites. This study highlights the need to understand the response of mangroves to cyclones, considering increased frequency with climate changes. Higher frequency of cyclones might prevent recovery, threatening the forest and associated coastal protection. However increased forest resilience can be gained with proper management.

TI Characterizing block graphs in terms of their vertex-induced partitions
SO AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF COMBINATORICS
AB Block graphs are a generalization of trees that arise in areas such as metric graph theory, molecular graphs, and phylogenetics. Given a finite connected simple graph G = (V, E) with vertex set V and edge set E subset of ((V)(2)), we will show that the (necessarily unique) smallest block graph with vertex set V whose edge set contains E is uniquely determined by the V-indexed family P-G = (pi(v) )(nu is an element of V) of the partitions pi(v) of the set V into the set of connected components of the graph (V, {e is an element of E : v is not an element of e}). Moreover, we show that an arbitrary V-indexed family P = (p(v))(v is an element of V) of partitions p(v) of the set V is of the form P = P-G for some connected simple graph G = (V, E) with vertex set V as above if and only if, for any two distinct elements u, v is an element of V, the union of the set in pv that contains u and the set in p(u) that contains v coincides with the set V, and {v} is an element of p(v) holds for all v is an element of V. As well as being of inherent interest to the theory of block graphs, these facts are also useful in the analysis of compatible decompositions of finite metric spaces.

TI Minimum order of r-regular bipartite graphs of pair length k
SO AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF COMBINATORICS
AB The concepts of k-pairable graphs and the pair length of a graph were introduced by Chen [Discrete Math. 287 (2004), 11-15] to generalize an elegant result of Graham et al. [Amer. Math. Monthly 101 (1994), 664-667] from hypercubes and graphs with antipodal isomorphisms to a much larger class of graphs. A graph G is k-pairable if there is a positive integer k such that the automorphism group of G contains an involution phi with the property that the distance between x and phi(x) is at least k for any vertex x of G. The pair length of a graph G, denoted by p(G), is the maximum positive integer k such that G is k-pairable; and p(G) = 0 if G is not k-pairable for any positive integer k.
   The aim of this paper is to answer an open question posted in our previous paper [Discrete Math. 310 (2010), 3334-3350]; that is, the question of determining the minimum order of a graph in the set of r-regular bipartite graphs of pair length k. We solve the problem for all positive integers k and r except for the case when both k >= 5 and r >= 3 are odd. For the case that is still open, we provide bounds on the minimum order concerned. Also we post a conjecture on the minimum order of a cubic bipartite graph of pair length k for any odd number k > 1.

TI Effects of invasive Green Iguanas (Iguana iguana) on seed germination
   and seed dispersal potential in southeastern Puerto Rico
SO BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB Green Iguanas (Iguana iguana) are invasive in Puerto Rico due to a variety of negative economic effects, yet we know very little about their ecological impacts. Because they are herbivorous, defecate intact seeds, move through the forest, and have long gut-passage times, Green Iguanas may affect seed germination and seed dispersal. In summer 2013, a total of 258 Green Iguana scat samples were collected at the Humacao Natural Reserve in southeastern Puerto Rico. Seeds extracted from scat and collected from fruit were planted under common garden conditions using experimental treatments designed to tease apart the effects of feces, fruit, and ingestion on seed germination. Green Iguanas decreased the time for seeds to germinate in Ficus spp. by removing fruit pulp, but had no effect on germination of native Annona glabra seeds. For non-native P. pterocarpus and Pterocarpus spp., Green Iguanas produced conflicting results, decreasing the percentage of seeds germinating, but at the same time, reducing the time for seeds to germinate. Green Iguanas likely disperse most seeds beyond the canopies of parental tree at our site. Government and economic resources are being used to eradicate Green Iguana populations in Puerto Rico, but the lack of consistent effects of Green Iguanas on seed germination for the plant species consumed at our site complicates generalizing about their ecological effects and developing management plans that minimize negative effects for native plant communities. We recommend additional studies that target both species of particular concern, such as threatened native or invasive species, as well as studies of sensitive habitats in Puerto Rico.

TI Habitat and climatic preferences drive invasions of non-native ambrosia
   beetles in deciduous temperate forests
SO BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB The introduction of non-native ambrosia beetles can cause severe damage in forest ecosystems. Understanding the environmental drivers affecting their invasion at the local scale is of utmost importance to enhancing management strategies. Our objectives were: (1) to determine the influence of forest composition, forest structure, and climate on invasion success of non-native ambrosia beetles in deciduous temperate forests, and (2) to test the effect of host tree species on colonization success by non-native ambrosia beetles. In 2013, we sampled 25 forest stands located in North-East Italy belonging to three forest types dominated respectively by hop hornbeam, chestnut, and beech. Both ethanol-baited traps and trap-logs of five tree species (hop hornbeam, chestnut, beech, manna ash, and black locust) were used to sample non-native and native ambrosia beetle communities. We found a clear effect of forest composition on non-native species richness and activity-density, as measured in ethanol-baited traps, both of which were higher in chestnut-dominated forests. Furthermore, we found a positive effect of temperature on both the number of trapped non-native species and their activity-density, with cold temperatures limiting beetle spread in high-elevation forests. Only Xylosandrus germanus successfully colonized the trap-logs. The number of colonized logs was higher for chestnut and in chestnut-dominated forests. Both trapping and log-baiting indicated that chestnut-dominated forests were at greater risk of invasion than hop hornbeam- and beech-dominated forests. Given the economic and ecological importance of chestnut, ambrosia beetle communities present in chestnut-dominated forests should be monitored to determine where protective measures must be taken.

TI Using an evapo-transpiration model (ETpN) to predict the risk and
   expression of symptoms of pine wilt disease (PWD) across Europe
SO BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB The pine wood nematode (PWN) Bursaphelenchus xylophilus is the causal agent of pine wilt disease (PWD), a xylem restricting disease of pine trees. PWN, a native of North America where it very rarely kills native pine trees, has spread internationally killing host trees in China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Portugal, with isolated incursions into Spain. Based on the locations where tree mortality has been recorded, it appears that pine trees growing in hot, dry conditions are more susceptible to pine wilt disease. This paper describes the ETpN model, an evapo-transpiration model (previously developed by Forest Research), which has been modified to incorporate the presence of PWN inside a tree and which predicts the regions of Europe that are likely to succumb to PWD. ETpN acts independently of the vector beetle (Monochamus spp.), predicting the likelihood of PWD on the assumption that a tree in a particular region has already been infested by the pine wood nematode. Different regions across Europe are included to investigate and demonstrate how different climates affect PWD incidence significantly. Simplified, "lite" and latency models have been developed to allow a non-specialist user to determine respectively the risk of PWD at a particular location and the likelihood of delays (latency) in expression of wilt symptoms.

TI The susceptibility of European tree species to invasive Asian pathogens:
   a literature based analysis
SO BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB Alien invasive pathogens have caused numerous disastrous epidemics around the globe during the last two centuries. The frequency of these catastrophes has increased in parallel with the increase of international plant trade. Effective control of the risks requires understanding of factors governing vulnerability of indigenous plants. We tested whether the threat caused by alien pathogens of Asian origin is random among various tree species in Europe or whether it relates to their distribution range. A database including distribution ranges of 75 European tree species and literature-derived information on their susceptibility to invasive forest pathogens (IFPs) of Asian origin was compiled. Analysis on this database indicated that the susceptibility to Asian pathogens is significantly more common among tree species that occur only within Europe than among species with distributional ranges from Europe to Siberia (disease susceptibility percentage, DSP, 52 and 19 %, respectively). Notably, all severely attacked tree species are strictly European while tree species with distribution ranges extending from Europe to Siberia show at most only mild or moderate symptoms of Asian IFPs. Furthermore, the proportion of European broadleaf tree species susceptible to Asian IFPs is significantly higher than that of conifer species. Our results suggest that in Europe, Asian pathogens cause a higher risk to temperate and Mediterranean forests, largely composed of broadleaved species with distributional ranges restricted to Europe, than to boreal forests dominated by conifers distributed to Siberia.

TI Livestock reduces juvenile tree growth of alien invasive species with a
   minimal effect on natives: a field experiment using exclosures
SO BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB Many alien invasive tree species were originally introduced to their non-native ranges for use in forestry and as urban trees. These alien species were selected for their fast growth and not necessarily for possessing mechanisms which deter browsing. Instead, many tree species native to semiarid areas of the world evolved mechanisms which deter browsing, presumably at the cost of slower growth. In a semiarid rangeland we observed that livestock exclusion greatly promoted the growth of juveniles of several alien species but not of native species, and we hypothesized that this increase in growth of aliens was due to livestock preference for alien and not native trees. With the objective of quantifying our observations and understanding the mechanism underlying the increased growth rates of alien juvenile trees under livestock exclusion, we assessed growth and browsing levels in juveniles of two alien invasive and four abundant native tree species within three parcels where livestock was excluded and three parcels with livestock at 0.20 cattle equivalents.ha(-1). Alien species grew around four-fold faster under livestock exclusion than with livestock and, as predicted, received five times more browsing than natives. Instead, native species did not significantly increase their growth rate with livestock exclusion. The results support our hypothesis and the implications for management would be that stocking paddocks with livestock to browse existing alien juveniles and re-growth of felled adults should be effective in delaying invasions of trees used for forestry without significantly affecting the growth of the most abundant native trees.

TI Response of floodplain understorey species to environmental gradients
   and tree invasion: a functional trait perspective
SO BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB Plants are connected to habitats by functional traits which are filtered by environmental gradients. Since tree species composition in the forest canopy can influence ecosystem processes by changing resource availability, litter accumulation, and soil nutrient content, we hypothesised that non-native invasive trees can establish new environmental filters on the understorey communities. In the hardwood floodplain forests in Northern Italy, the invasive trees Robinia pseudoacacia L. and Prunus serotina Ehrh. are the dominant canopy species. We used trait data assembled from databases and iterative RLQ analysis to identify a parsimonious set of functional traits responding to environmental variables (soil, light availability, disturbance, and stand structure) and the dominant native and invasive canopy species. Then, RLQ and fourth-corner analysis was conducted to investigate the joint structure between macro-environmental variables and species traits and functional groups were identified. The trait composition of the herb-layer was significantly related to the main environmental gradients and the presence of the invaders in the canopy showed significant relationships with several traits. In particular, the presence of P. serotina may mitigate or even erase the effect of disturbances, maintaining a stable forest microclimate and thus favouring 'true' forest species, while R. pseudoacacia may slow down forest succession and regeneration by establishing new stable associations with a graminoid-dominated understorey. The impact of the two invasive trees on herb layer composition appears to differ, indicating that different management and control strategies may be needed.

TI Influence of the agricultural management practices on the yield and
   quality of poplar biomass (a 9-year study)
SO BIOMASS & BIOENERGY
AB The aim of this work is to study the effect of different agricultural management on the yield and quality of two poplar biomass clones (AF2 and I-214 clones) in short rotation coppices (SRC), which were harvested using different alternatives (with and without cutting and sprouting after the first year), with two fertilisation doses and through three different 3-year rotation cycles. The plantation was established in 2006 in a marginal land at 1100 m above sea level in central-northern Spain. Yields were evaluated and biomass samples were analysed to determine the quality of the biomass for energy purposes. Biomass quality was estimated taking into account calorific value, volatile matter, ash content, carbon, nitrogen, sulphur and chlorine contents, as well as the chemical composition and melting behaviour of their ashes.
   The highest yields, around 9 dry tons per hectare and year, were obtained in this marginal land during the first and second rotation cycles when plots received a supplementary fertilisation. Both clones (AF2 and I-214) provided similar yield and biomass quality. Plots where poplar was not harvested the first year (without cutting and sprouting after the first year) provided higher accumulated yields. Poplar biomass from SRC can be considered a suitable solid biofuel due to its appropriate ash melting behaviour and its low content of nitrogen (0.44 wt-%), sulphur (0.03 wt-%) and chlorine (around 0.01 wt-%). No important significance effect on the poplar quality can be found depending on the additional fertilisation. Poplar quality varied as a function of root/stem age. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Processing and sorting forest residues: Cost, productivity and
   managerial impacts
SO BIOMASS & BIOENERGY
AB Feedstocks generated from processing forest residues have traditionally been considered as a low value product. The economic potential of these materials can be enhanced by emerging biomass conversion technologies, such as torrefaction, briquetting, and gasification; however, these systems require higher quality feedstock. The objective of this study was to determine the cost of processing and sorting forest residues to produce feedstock, so that the best comminution machines (i.e. chipper vs. grinder) could be used to better control feedstock size distribution. The tree tops left from sawlog processing and small-diameter trees were delimbed and separated from the slash pile. Three harvest units were selected and each unit was divided into three sub-treatment units (no-, moderate, and intensive sorting). Results showed that the cost of operations were higher for the sorted sub-units when compared to the non-sorted. The total cost of operation (felling to loading) for sawlogs was lowest at 40.81 $ m(-3) in the nosorting treatment unit, followed by moderate (42.25 $ m(-3)) and intensive treatment unit (44.75 $ m(-3)). For biomass harvesting, the cost of operation (felling to delimbing and sorting) ranged from 27 to 29 $ oven dry metric ton(-1). The most expensive operational phase was primary transportation; therefore, cost of treating the forest residues had less impact on the overall cost. The cost increase (1150 $ ha(-1)) of sorting forest residues could offset cost savings from avoided site preparation expenses (1100 $ ha(-1)), provided that the forest residues were utilized.

TI Storage of whole-tree chips from high-density energy plantations of
   Eucalyptus in Brazil
SO BIOMASS & BIOENERGY
AB In this paper, the drying of whole-tree chip (WTC) storage from young Eucalyptus plantation managed at short-rotation coppice in Brazil was studies. The biomass was converted from high-density energy plantations of Eucalyptus grandis at 2 years old into four piles. Wood chip particles had 5, 15, and 30 mm length were disposed on a paved surface to evaluate the effect on the chip drying. An additional covered pile (30-mm wood chip) was installed to evaluate the effect of coverage condition. The non-ventilated and uncovered piles were not affected by WTC length, and the final moisture content (MC) was 48.4-53.5% and temperature inside the piles (storage temperature) was approximately 36 degrees C. However, the coverage showed beneficial effect on drying wood chip process, collaborating to keep the MC lower than 35%, conventionally recommended for energy purposes. Among storage systems studied, the higher daily moisture content was assigned to covered pile, about 0.197% day(-1) during the first 30 days. This paper can be used as a reference for further studies with wood chip pile storage at tropical conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Comparison of a logistic regression and Naive Bayes classifier in
   landslide susceptibility assessments: The influence of models complexity
   and training dataset size
SO CATENA
AB The main objective of the present study was to compare the performance of a classifier that implements the Logistic Regression and a classifier that employs a Naive Bayes algorithm in landslide susceptibility assessments. The study provides an evaluation concerning the influence of model's complexity and the size of the training data, while it identifies the most accurate and reliable classifier.
   The comparison of the two classifiers was based on the assessment of a database containing 116 sites located at the mountains of Epirus, Greece, where serious landslides events have been encountered. The sites are classified into two categories, non-landslide and landslide areas. The identification of those areas was established by analysing airborne imagery, extensive field investigation and the examination of previous research studies. Thegeo-environmental conditions in those locations where analyzed in regard with their susceptibility to slide. In particular, seven variables where analyzed: engineering, geological units, slope angle, slope aspect, mean annual rainfall, distance from river network, distance from tectonic features and distance from road network.
   Multicollinearity analysis and feature selection was implemented in order to estimate the conditional independence among the variables and to rank the variables according to their significance in estimating landslide susceptibility. By the above processes the construction of nine different datasets was accomplished. Further partition allowed creating subsets of training and validating data from the original 116 sites. Each dataset was characterized by the number of the variables used and the size of the training datasets.
   The comparison and validation of the outcomes of each model was achieved using statistical evaluation measures, the receiving operating characteristic and the area under the success and predictive rate curves. The results indicated that model's complexity and the size of the training dataset influence the accuracy and the predictive power of the models concerning landslide susceptibility. In particular, the most accurate model with high predictive power was the eighth model (five variables and 92 training data), with the Naive Bayes classifier having a slightly higher overall performance and accuracy than the Logistic Regression classifier, 87.50% and 82.61% on the validation datasets, respectively. The highest area under the curve was achieved by the Naive Bayes classifier for, both the training and validating datasets (0.875 and 0.806 respectively) while the Logistic Regression classifier achieved a lower AUC values for the training and validating datasets (0.844 and 0.711, respectively). When limited data are available it seems that more accurate and reliable results could be obtained by generative classifiers, like Naive Bayes classifiers. Overall, landslide susceptibility assessments could serve as a useful tool for the local and national authorities, in order to evaluate strategies to prevent and mitigate the adverse impacts of landslide events.

TI Effects of 'red unit' deposit on Acacia trees in the hyper-arid southern
   Israel
SO CATENA
AB During the last few decades, populations of the Acacia genus across the hyper-arid Arava Valley and southern Negev have faced considerable demographic changes, with high mortality rates as a predominant trend. We suggest that, in addition to the decreasing precipitation rates and the resultant decrease in flood events during this period, these changes are not homogenous across the region but are related to the type of wadis' (ephemeral streams') riverbed. The largest part of the wadis across the region is covered by stony alluvium stratum. At the same time, a small share of the area and some of the wadis are covered by a hard (cement-like) paleo layer of fine-grained reddish sediments ('red unit' deposit, also named the Zehiha Formation). Of the most important observable differences is the high rock fragment (particles > 2000 Fun) content in the alluvium as opposed to the practically no rock fragment content in the red unit. The Acacia trees and wadi riverbeds (alluvium stratum/red unit deposit) were studied in six wadis during the summer of 2015. Of these wadis, three contain an alluvium stratum and other three, a red unit deposit. The study results revealed very high variability in terms of overall (both alive and dead) tree density in the wadis. Yet, the mean overall tree density was (though not significantly, P = 0.5463) 42% greater in the red unit deposit than that in the alluvium stratum. At the same time, mean percentage of alive trees was significantly (P = 0.0437) and 9% greater in the red unit deposit than that in the alluvium stratum. Generally, characteristics of the red unit deposit indicated much better soil quality than those of the alluvium stratum. These included the texture (clayey in the red unit vs. sandy in the alluvium), hygroscopic moisture content (fivefold greater in the red unit), soil organic carbon concentration (69% greater in the red unit), and calcium carbonate content (24% smaller in the red unit). Above all, means of both water field capacity and permanent wilting point were approximately threefold greater in the red unit deposit than that in the alluvium stratum, resulting in the mean available water capacity to be threefold greater in the red unit than that in the alluvium. Strongly positive and significant (P < 0.0001) correlation was found between the percentage of alive trees and available water capacity (r = 0.91), but not between overall tree density and this variable. It is concluded that as long as precipitation regime and flood frequency are normal (similar to the long-term average) in these hyper arid drylands, the Acacia similarly grow and establish under both the red unit deposit and alluvium stratum. However, once long-term droughts or climatic change occur, with the resultant decrease in precipitation rates and flood frequency, the red unit deposit alleviates water stress, considerably increasing Acacia vitality and survivability.

TI A Survey of VLSI Implementations of Tree Search Algorithms for MIMO
   Detection
SO CIRCUITS SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING
AB Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detection algorithms have received considerable research interest in recent years, as a result of the increasing need for high data-rate communications. Detection techniques range from the low-complexity linear detectors to the maximum likelihood detector, which scales exponentially with the number of transmit antennas. In between these two extremes are the tree search (TS) algorithms, such as the popular sphere decoder, which have emerged as attractive choices for implementing MIMO detection, due to their excellent performance-complexity trade-offs. In this paper, we survey some of the state-of-the-art VLSI implementations of TS algorithms and compare their results using various metrics such as the throughput and power consumption. We also present notable contributions that have been made in the last three decades in implementing TS algorithms for MIMO detection, especially with respect to achieving low-complexity, high-throughput designs. Finally, a number of design considerations and trade-offs for implementing MIMO detectors in hardware are presented.

TI Effects of irrigation deprivation and ground cover (Trifolium repens) in
   the tree row on brown rot incidence in peach
SO CROP PROTECTION
AB Brown rot can lead to considerable fruit losses in peach orchards and cultural practices likely to contend this major disease have to be promoted. In order to limit peach brown rot incidence in a three-year-old mid-season maturing peach orchard of the cultivar 'Ruby Bright', four combinations of irrigation and soil management treatments were assessed: conventional (Cony) irrigation (I) and soil management (S) (Convl+ConvS); modified (Mod) irrigation and soil management (Modl+ConvS); conventional irrigation and modified soil management (Convl+ModS); and modified irrigation and soil management (ModI+ModS). Conventional irrigation and soil management in the tree row consisted of irrigation scheduling using tensiometer readings and herbicide use, respectively. Modified irrigation and soil management in the tree row consisted of water deprivation during stage III of fruit development and ground cover with white clover, respectively. For four consecutive years (2010-2013), in the conditions of the Middle Rhone Valley in France, the lowest and highest brown rot incidence were detected under (Modl+ModS) and (Convl+ConvS), respectively, whereas brown rot incidence under (Modl+ConvS) and (Convl+ModS) was intermediate. This lower brown rot incidence under the modified treatments occurred from one to two weeks before fruit maturity and was still observed for several days in post-harvest storage. Ground cover with white clover was shown to limit water availability in the soil after heavy rainfall compared to bare soil, probably limiting peach growth variations, well-known as a possible source of detrimental micro cracks at the fruit surface. This suggests that under our conditions appropriate cultural practices, water deprivation and a clover crop cover in the tree row possibly decrease peach disease sensitivity, which might lead to the reduced use of pesticide sprays to control brown rot in the orchard.

TI Integration of acibenzolar-S-methyl with antibiotics for protection of
   pear and apple from fire blight caused by Erwinia amylovora
SO CROP PROTECTION
AB Orchard experiments on integration of acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM) with antibiotics for protection of pear and apple from fire blight were conducted in the west coast region of the United States over a period of 5 years. In 11 pathogen-inoculated trials, a single treatment of streptomycin or oxytetracycline provided an average of 84 and 60% disease control, respectively. The addition of one or two treatments of acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM) to the single antibiotic program contributed an additional 6 and 11% disease control, respectively, for both antibiotic materials. Among trials, ASM treatment timings were varied from early to late bloom but an effect of timing on disease control could not be determined. In mature commercial pear orchards, ASM treatments at full bloom and petal fall were superimposed onto the grower's antibiotic program used in each orchard. For the 15 orchards with fire blight, the ASM-treated plots showed 38% fewer infections than adjoining plots that received antibiotic program only. When integrated with antibiotics, ASM provides added disease suppression to fire blight control programs, but the modest degree of protection provided will likely limit its use to high disease risk situations, which includes orchards with a previous disease history, and those planted recently to highly susceptible cultivars.

TI There's no place like home: seedling mortality contributes to the
   habitat specialisation of tree species across Amazonia
SO ECOLOGY LETTERS
AB Understanding the mechanisms generating species distributions remains a challenge, especially in hyperdiverse tropical forests. We evaluated the role of rainfall variation, soil gradients and herbivory on seedling mortality, and how variation in seedling performance along these gradients contributes to habitat specialisation. In a 4-year experiment, replicated at the two extremes of the Amazon basin, we reciprocally transplanted 4638 tree seedlings of 41 habitat-specialist species from seven phylogenetic lineages among the three most important forest habitats of lowland Amazonia. Rainfall variation, flooding and soil gradients strongly influenced seedling mortality, whereas herbivory had negligible impact. Seedling mortality varied strongly among habitats, consistent with predictions for habitat specialists in most lineages. This suggests that seedling performance is a primary determinant of the habitat associations of adult trees across Amazonia. It further suggests that tree diversity, currently mostly harboured in terra firme forests, may be strongly impacted by the predicted climate changes in Amazonia.

TI Citrus rootstocks regulate the nutritional status and antioxidant system
   of trees under copper stress
SO ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY
AB Copper (Cu) deficiency and toxicity cause stresses in citrus orchards and limited information is available about which rootstocks and associated mechanisms would enhance plant resistance to such nutritional disorders. Therefore, this study evaluated the nutritional status and antioxidant system responses of citrus grafted onto selected rootstocks differing in horticultural performance [Swingle citrumelo (SW) or Rangpur lime (RL)], grown in nutrient solution with varying concentrations of Cu (0.015, 0.60 or 24.0 mu M). The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse using young sweet orange trees. Once taken up, Cu mostly accumulated in roots (75% of total plant Cu content). Trees grafted onto RL were more responsive to enzyme activities related to oxidative stress and to nitrogen metabolism in leaves when grown in the presence of either the lowest or the highest Cu concentrations used. Those grown in 24.0 mu M Cu displayed decreased overall nutrient uptake and accumulation, with the exception of iron, which was predominantly found in roots. Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase activity in leaves was dependent upon signalling regulated by rootstocks, being lower in SW than in RL. Therefore, the use of appropriate rootstock varieties contributes to alleviate the effects of Cu stress on the metabolism and nutritional status of citrus plants. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI The effect of light quality on growth, photosynthesis, leaf anatomy and
   volatile isoprenoids of a monoterpene-emitting herbaceous species
   (Solanum lycopersicum L.) and an isoprene-emitting tree (Platanus
   orientalis L.)
SO ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY
AB The effect of different light qualities on growth, photosynthesis, leaf anatomy and isoprenoid emission was studied in two different fast-growing plant systems: a herbaceous crop, tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.), and a tree, oriental plane (Platanus orientalis L.). Both plant species were subjected to three different light quality regimes: RGB (Red 33%, Green 33%, Blue 33%) and RB (Red 66%, Blue 33%), provided by light emitting diodes (LED); and white light (WL), considered as a control and provided by white fluorescent lamps. Compared to WL, RGB and RB reduced plant height, plant biomass and leaf area. The CO2 assimilation rate (A) was lower in tomato grown under WL than RGB and RB, while A was similar in oriental plane leaves exposed to the three light regimes. In tomato, stomatal (g(s)) and mesophyll (g(m)) conductance were higher under RGB and RB compared to WL. In plane, gs was also higher under RGB and RB, while gm was not significantly influenced by different light qualities. In both species, leaf lamina thickness (LT) and stomata size were the anatomical traits most affected by the different light regimes. In tomato, leaf lamina thickness was significantly reduced in RGB and RB leaves, whereas in oriental plane leaf lamina thickness was significantly higher in RGB and RB than in WL leaves. In both species, RB leaves showed bigger stomata size than WL and RGB leaves. Light quality also affected photosynthesis dependent volatile isoprenoids. In tomato, beta-phellandrene was lower under RB and RGB compared to WL. However, RGB and RB stimulated alpha-pinene, carene and alpha-terpinene emissions. Oriental plane released about 14 nmol m(-2) s(-1) isoprene when growing at WL, while the emission was reduced under RGB and even more under RB. In summary, photosynthetic performance, leaf anatomy, biomass production, and volatile isoprenoids are affected by light quality differently in tomato and plane plants. Light quality control may have important applications to modulate plant productivity and increase biosynthesis of useful biochemical compounds. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Carbon starvation by light deprivation does not constrain the ability of
   young pines to produce induced chemical defences in response to a
   bark-chewing herbivore
SO ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY
AB Pine tree chemical defence is based on constitutive and inducible carbon-rich substances (mainly oleoresin and phenolic compounds) present in pine tissues in conspicuously high concentrations. Resistance at early stages is essential for future fitness, and allocation of carbon resources to chemical defences may signify a relevant carbon sink for juvenile pines. However there is still poor knowledge about the extent to which allocation priorities of recently assimilated and stored C pools to chemical defences are plastic in response to biotic stress. We aimed to determine the extent to which the production of induced chemical defences in pine trees in response to herbivory depends on the availability of current photosynthates or if they can be built upon stored C pools. Two years-old trees of three pine species (Pinus pinaster, Pinus sylvestris and Pinus radiata) were exposed to real herbivory by the pine weevil Hylobius abietis, a bark-chewing insect, during one week under conditions of either natural sunlight or complete light deprivation. Weevil damage and the concentration of chemical defences in the whole stem were measured in a time-course design with destructive sampling. We analysed, using an ANCOVA approach, whether the ability to increase the concentration of chemical defences in response to weevil damage was altered by light deprivation. We hypothesised that if induced defences are built mainly upon current photoassimilates, then carbon starvation by light deprivation should strongly hamper the production of new defences. For all pine species, concentration of non-volatile resin significantly increased in response to weevil damage, which was more intense under dark conditions. ANCOVA analysis showed that light deprivation did not constrain the ability of young pines to respond to weevil damage by increasing non-volatile resin content in the stems. No significant covariation was found for total polyphenolics. By evaluating chemical defences in the whole stem, and restricting C assimilation by complete light deprivation, we can infer that young pines were able to use other carbon sources than current photosynthates, likely stored carbon pools, for de novo synthesis of induced chemical defences in response to insect herbivory. Disentangling the plasticity in the use of C sources for the synthesis of induced defences is crucial for understanding the ability of pine trees to respond to multiple stressors in a changing environment.

TI Mitogen activated protein kinase 4 (MPK4) influences growth in Populus
   tremula L. x tremuloides
SO ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY
AB Mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs or MPKs) are important molecular regulators involved in plant development and stress responses. Arabidopsis MPK4 was proved to play a crucial role in the regulation of cytokinesis, hormonal homeostasis and defence responses against bacteria and oomycetes. The aim of this work was to distinguish the function of MPK4 in poplar. Therefore, we generated transgenic lines of Populus tremula x tremuloides with the reduction of poplar MPK4 expression. Two independent lines mpk4-5 and mpk4-7 were selected and cultivated in the field for four vegetative seasons. Transgenic lines with reduced expression of MPK4 displayed higher foliar content of free salicylic acid (SA), elevated cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and antioxidant enzymes activities. Moreover, they proved increased photosynthetic efficiency as well as chlorophyll and carotenoid contents. Despite effective photosynthetic processes, MPK4-silenced trees demonstrated reduced growth, which could be caused by significantly elevated stomatal conductance that lead to higher transpiration and lower water use efficiency. Changes in the lignification process and secondary growth of stems could be the other reason for retarded growth in these lines. Altogether, our results indicate that MPK4 is responsible for controlling PSII efficiency, chloroplast retrograde signalling, cellular ROS/SA homeostasis and water management, leading to changes in growth and development in woody plant species grown in the field.

TI Diversity and potential impact of Botryosphaeriaceae species associated
   with Eucalyptus globulus plantations in Portugal
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB Eucalyptus globulus, a non-native species, is currently the most abundant forest species in Portugal. This economically important forest tree is exploited mainly for the production of pulp for the paper industry. The community of Botryosphaeriaceae species occurring on diseased and healthy E. globulus trees was studied on plantations throughout the country. Nine species from three different genera were identified, namely Botryosphaeria (B. dothidea), Diplodia (D. corticola and D. seriata) and Neofusicoccum (N. australe, N. algeriense, N. eucalyptorum, N. kwambonambiense, N. parvum and Neofusicoccum sp.). Of these, N. algeriense, D. corticola and D. seriata are reported for the first time on E. globulus, while N. algeriense, N. eucalyptorum and N. kwambonambiense correspond to first reports in Portugal. The genus Neofusicoccum was clearly dominant with N. australe and N. eucalyptorum being the most abundant species on both diseased and healthy trees. In artificial inoculation trials representative isolates from all nine species were shown to be pathogenic to E. globulus but there were marked differences in aggressiveness between them. Thus, D. corticola and N. kwambonambiense were the most aggressive while B. dothidea and D. seriata were the least aggressive of the species studied.

TI Phylogeny, morphology and pathogenicity of Botryosphaeriaceae,
   Diatrypaceae and Gnomoniaceae associated with branch diseases of
   hazelnut in Sardinia (Italy)
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB Severe trunk and branch diseases of hazelnut trees have recently been observed in several groves in Sardinia (Italy). Since there is little information about the aetiology of these diseases and given the high ecological and economic importance of these agro-systems, an in-depth study was carried out. From autumn 2012 to spring 2014, sixty samples of twigs and branches of hazelnut trees showing exudates and different types of canker (sunken with wedge-shaped necrotic sector, open canker and Cytospora canker) were collected in the main hazelnut growing area in the centre of the island. Based on morphology, colony appearance and DNA sequence data, seven species belonging to four genera and three families were isolated and identified. These included Diplodia sapinea, D. seriata, Dothiorella iberica, Do. parva and Do. symphoricarposicola (Botryosphaeriaceae), Gnomoniopsis smithogilvyi (Gnomoniaceae) and Anthostoma decipiens (Diatrypaceae). In addition, two new species namely Diaporthella cryptica sp. nov. and Dothiorella omnivora sp. nov. are described. Pathogenicity trials carried out on wounded hazelnut branches showed that three species, Anthostoma decipiens, Diaporthella cryptica and Diplodia seriata are aggressive pathogens on hazelnut. Results obtained have allowed us to clarify, almost a century after its first description, the aetiology of the disease known as Cytospora canker of hazelnut and to reveal the existence of three evolutionarily distinct lineages for its causal agent A. decipiens. The diversity of fungal pathogens associated with twig and branch cankers of hazelnut is greater than previously recognised and further studies are necessary to determine the exact role played by each species and their possible synergistic interaction.

TI First occurrence of Diaphorina citri in East Africa, characterization of
   the Ca. Liberibacter species causing huanglongbing (HLB) in Tanzania,
   and potential further spread of D-citri and HLB in Africa and Europe
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB Citrus surveys were conducted at high (> 700 m), medium (300-600 m) and low (< 200 m) altitudes in Tanzania in 2014/15. Adults and nymphs of Trioza erytreae (del Guercio) were abundant in the highlands and less abundant at medium altitudes. Unexpectedly, adults and nymphs of Diaphorina citri Kuwayama, the Asian citrus psyllid, were found and collected at medium altitudes, around Morogoro. No psyllids were observed at low altitudes. Severe huanglongbing symptoms and tree decline were evident at high altitudes, while mild and few symptoms were observed at intermediate and low altitudes, respectively. DNA was extracted from leaf and psyllid samples and subjected to conventional PCR (cPCR) with seven different primer sets and RT qPCR with two primer sets. cPCR bands were sequenced and subjected to phylogenetic analysis. Candidatus Liberibacter africanus (Laf) was detected in highland leaf and T. erytreae samples from high and medium altitudes by all methods. Sequences from leaves and psyllids were similar to those from South Africa. Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (Las) was detected by qPCR in medium altitude leaf samples, but cross-reaction with Laf was likely because presence of Las was not confirmed by cPCR and sequencing. Neither Laf nor Las were detected in D. citri samples. This is the first reported occurrence of D. citri in Africa. Predictions were made of the potential distribution of D. citri and Las in Africa and along the Mediterranean coast using the correlative models MAXENT and Multi-Model Framework. Additional surveys at medium and low altitudes and quarantine measures are recommended.

TI Geomorphic changes of a coral shingle cay measured using Kite Aerial
   Photography
SO GEOMORPHOLOGY
AB Measurements of geomorphic change in the intertidal zones of coral reefs are made using a variety of remote sensing and in-situ techniques, where variations in the coverage and spatial-temporal precision achieved are directly related to the cost of data acquisition. We present a novel, low-cost technique for measuring high resolution changes in reef environments based on Kite Aerial Photography (KAP) and photogrammetry/structure-from-motion post-processing. KAP images are used to measure fine-scale changes in intertidal topography and sediment texture characteristics, including rubble particle size, of a coral shingle cay at One Tree Island, Great Barrier Reef in the context of storm activity. Validation using Real Time Kinematic DGPS demonstrates the ability to measure topographic elevation with an error of 5.53 cm (RMSE) and a spatial resolution of 5 cm per point, an accuracy/resolution that is superior to airborne LiDAR and equivalent to terrestrial LiDAR, but at a fraction of the equipment cost.

TI Effect of Cryogenic Temperature on Tree Characteristics in Silicone
   Rubber/SiO2 Nanocomposites Under Repetitive Pulse Voltage
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED SUPERCONDUCTIVITY
AB Silicone rubber (SiR) is an important insulating material in high-voltage cable accessories. Electrical tree is a typical electrical aging inside SiR insulation and will cause breakdown when it reaches the ground. The tree characteristics may be changed by the cryogenic temperature because of the changing physicochemical properties. Besides, at temperatures above 273 K, addition of nanoparticles into SiR has been proved to have the effect of improving insulating properties. However, the effect of temperature and nanoparticles from 273 to 77 K under repetitive pulse voltage has not been researched. In this paper, the samples were prepared by mixing nano-SiO2 into liquid SiR and the proportion was set to be 0 wt%, 0.5 wt%, 1.0 wt%, 1.5 wt%, and 2.0 wt%, respectively. The experiment temperature was set to be 243, 213, 183, and 77 K. Repetitive pulse voltage was employed to generate electrical trees between the needle-plate electrodes. The growing process of electrical tree was recorded by a microscope system and pictures were captured. The experiment results indicated that both the cryogenic temperature and nanoparticles influence the treeing process in SiR/SiO2 nanocomposites.

TI Effect of Magnetic Field on Electrical Treeing Behavior of Silicone
   Rubber at Low Temperature
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED SUPERCONDUCTIVITY
AB The development of high temperature superconducting (HTS) materials promotes the development of HTS cable. With the development of HTS cable technology, superconducting insulating materials under magnetic field have been taken seriously. This paper presents the study of the relationship between magnetic field and growth characteristics of the electrical tree in silicone rubber. The test was done under -30 degrees C, -60 degrees C, and liquid nitrogen temperature. Needle-plate electrode was employed in this paper to generate electrical tree, and silver needle was employed to avoid stress generated by the magnetic field. Samples were applied pulse voltage of +12 kV and +15 kV. 0, 200, and 400 mT magnetic field density (MFD) was applied, respectively. The direction of the magnetic field and the electric field was vertical. Using a digital microscope captured the morphology of the tree. The fractal dimension and the accumulated damage were measured. It is observed that the magnetic field promotes the increase of accumulated damage and tree width increase rapidly with the increase of MFD. The magnetic field will increase the probability of the electrical tree in liquid nitrogen. This shows that the partial discharge activity in the tree channel is influenced by the Lorentz force, the treeing behavior will be different as a result.

TI Fast, Memory-Efficient Construction of Voxelized Shadows
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS
AB We present a fast and memory efficient algorithm for generating Compact Precomputed Voxelized Shadows. By performing much of the common sub-tree merging before identical nodes are ever created, we improve construction times by several orders of magnitude for large data structures, and require much less working memory. To further improve performance, we suggest two new algorithms with which the remaining common sub-trees can be merged. We also propose a new set of rules for resolving undefined regions, which significantly reduces the final memory footprint of the already heavily compressed data structure. Additionally, we examine the feasibility of using CPVS for many local lights and present two improvements to the original algorithm that allow us to handle hundreds of lights with high-quality, filtered shadows at real-time frame rates.

TI 3D Beam Tracing Based on Visibility Lookup for Interactive Acoustic
   Modeling
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS
AB We present a method for accelerating the computation of specular reflections in complex 3D enclosures, based on acoustic beam tracing. Our method constructs the beam tree on the fly through an iterative lookup process of a precomputed data structure that collects the information on the exact mutual visibility among all reflectors in the environment (region-to-region visibility). This information is encoded in the form of visibility regions that are conveniently represented in the space of acoustic rays using the Plucker coordinates. During the beam tracing phase, the visibility of the environment from the source position (the beam tree) is evaluated by traversing the precomputed visibility data structure and testing the presence of beams inside the visibility regions. The Plucker parameterization simplifies this procedure and reduces its computational burden, as it turns out to be an iterative intersection of linear subspaces. Similarly, during the path determination phase, acoustic paths are found by testing their presence within the nodes of the beam tree data structure. The simulations show that, with an average computation time per beam in the order of a dozen of microseconds, the proposed method can compute a large number of beams at rates suitable for interactive applications with moving sources and receivers.

TI Visualizing Dynamic Hierarchies in Graph Sequences
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS
AB Graphs are used to model relations between objects, where these objects can be grouped hierarchically based on their connectivity. In many applications, the relations change over time and so does the hierarchical group structure. We developed a visualization technique that supports the analysis of the topology and the hierarchical group structure of a dynamic graph and the tracking of changes over time. Each graph of a sequence is visualized by an adjacency matrix, where the hierarchical group structure is encoded within the matrix using indentation and nested contours, complemented by icicle plots attached to the matrices. The density within and between subgroups of the hierarchy is represented within the matrices using a gray scale. To visualize changes, transitions and dissimilarities between the hierarchically structured graphs are shown using a flow metaphor and color coding. The design of our visualization technique allows us to show more than one hierarchical group structure of the same graph by stacking the sequences, where hierarchy comparison is supported not only within but also between sequences. To improve the readability, we minimize the number of crossing curves within and between sequences based on a sorting algorithm that sweeps through the sequences of hierarchies.

TI Using machine learning to support healthcare professionals in making
   preauthorisation decisions
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS
AB Background: Preauthorisation is a control mechanism that is used by Health Insurance Providers (HIPs) to minimise wastage of resources through the denial of the procedures that were unduly requested. However, an efficient preauthorisation process requires the round-the-clock presence of a preauthorisation reviewer, which increases the operating expenses of the HIP. In this context, the aim of this study was to learn the preauthorisation process using the dental set from an existing database of a non-profit HIP.
   Methods: Pre-processing data techniques as filtering algorithms, random under-sample and imputation were used to mitigate problems that arise from the selection of relevant attributes, class balancing and filling unknown data. The performance of classifiers Random Tree, Naive bayes, Support Vector Machine and Nearest Neighbor was evaluated according to kappa index and the best classifiers were combined by using ensembles.
   Results: The number of attributes were reduced from 164 to 15 and also were created 12 new attributes from existing discrete data associated with the beneficiary's history. The final result was the development of a decision support mechanism that yielded hit rates above 96%.
   Conclusions: It is possible to create a tool based on computational intelligence techniques to evaluate the requests of test/procedure with a high accuracy. This tool can be used to support the activities of the professionals and automatically evaluate less complex cases, like requests not involving risk to the life of patients.

TI Parameterized verification through view abstraction
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON SOFTWARE TOOLS FOR TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER
AB We present a simple and efficient framework for automatic verification of systems with a parametric number of communicating processes. The processes may be organized in various topologies such as words, multisets, rings, or trees. Our method needs to inspect only a small number of processes in order to show correctness of the whole system. It relies on an abstraction function that views the system from the perspective of a fixed number of processes. The abstraction is used during the verification procedure in order to dynamically detect cut-off points beyond which the search of the state space need not continue. We show that the method is complete for a large class of well quasi-ordered systems including Petri nets. Our experimentation on a variety of benchmarks demonstrate that the method is highly efficient and that it works well even for classes of systems with undecidable verification problems. In particular, the method handles the fine-grained and full version of Szymanski's mutual exclusion protocol, whose correctness, to the best of our knowledge, has not been proven automatically by any other existing methods.

TI A Structure Theorem for Strong Immersions
SO JOURNAL OF GRAPH THEORY
AB A graph H is strongly immersed in G if H is obtained from G by a sequence of vertex splittings (i.e., lifting some pairs of incident edges and removing the vertex) and edge removals. Equivalently, vertices of H are mapped to distinct vertices of G (branch vertices) and edges of H are mapped to pairwise edge-disjoint paths in G, each of them joining the branch vertices corresponding to the ends of the edge and not containing any other branch vertices. We describe the structure of graphs avoiding a fixed graph as a strong immersion. The theorem roughly states that a graph which excludes a fixed graph as a strong immersion has a tree-like decomposition into pieces glued together on small edge cuts such that each piece of the decomposition has a path-like linear decomposition isolating the high degree vertices.

TI Hybrid knowledge model of process planning and its green extension
SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING
AB The green process planning model was a necessary research field of the green manufacturing, which has drawn increasing attention from many scholars. This study proposes a multi-method [Backus-Naur Form (BNF) frame, binary tree,production rules, and objective-oriented methodology] hybrid frame model of process planning and reasoning mechanism. In this model, the hierarchical BNF frame was applied to modeling the structure of parts, the stages of process decisions and the existing green process indicators set. Then, two "procedure" programs were designed for the information exchange among the above models. This green-process planning model was proposed based on the traditional intelligent process planning model and was intended to introduce an overall (compared with the traditional partial green-process planning model) green-process decision mode. In the last section of this paper, a case study of the green-process planning for a stepped shaft is provided along with a number of essential knowledge models to illustrate the feasibility of this hybrid knowledge model.

TI Evaluating the Woody Species Diversity by Means of Remotely Sensed
   Spectral and Texture Measures in the Urban Forests
SO JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
AB There is an urgent need to obtain an accurate data on biological diversity and its temporal variation, in order to adopt an appropriate protection strategy to manage the urban forest remnants on sustainable manner for future generations. RapidEye Satellite images with spatial resolution of 5 x 5 m (orthorectified pixel size), ASTER VNIR images with spatial resolution of 15 x 15 m and Landsat-8 OLI images with spatial resolution of 30 x 30 m were used to evaluate the woody species diversity in urban forest remnants. Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) was used to determine the relationships between the woody species diversity at Alpha (alpha) level and the spectral & texture properties derived from the satellite images. PCC test showed a positive significant relationship between the brightness of the RapidEye satellite image (i.e., Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index; ARVI) and the Simpson's Diversity Index (S) (r = 0.80, p < 0.01). In order to also estimate the beta (beta) diversity in the study, the relationship between species rarefaction curves and spectral rarefaction curves was calculated through multiple regression analysis i.e., Landsat NDVI, ASTER NDVI and RapidEye NDVI (respectively, R-2 = 0.99; 0.99; 0.98, p < 0.01). The findings of the study revealed that satellite image with a resolution of 5 m would be more appropriate to estimate the woody species diversity of urban forest remnants. However, medium resolution satellite images (Landsat) may be used to examine the species rarefaction curve and beta diversity in forest remnants.

TI Present diversity of Galapagos leaf-toed geckos (Phyllodactylidae:
   Phyllodactylus) stems from three independent colonization events
SO MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION
AB We re-examined the biogeography of the leaf-toed geckos (Phyllodactylus) endemic to the Galapagos Islands by analyzing for the first time samples of P. gilberti, a species endemic to Wolf island, in a phylogenetic framework. Our aim was to test the three-colonizations scenario previously proposed for these lizards and estimate the age of each colonization event. To achieve this we estimated simultaneously a species tree and divergence times with Bayesian methods. Our results supported the three colonizations scenario. Similar to a previous hypothesis, the species tree obtained here showed that most species of Phyllodactylus are nested in a single Glade with an age between 5.49 and 13.8 Ma, whereas a second independent colonization corresponding to P. darwini from San Cristobal island occurred 3.03 Ma ago. The species from Wolf island, P. gilberti, stems from a more recent colonization event (0.69 Ma). Thus, present diversity of Galapagos leaf-toed geckos stems from three independent, asynchronous colonization events. As with other Galapagos organisms, the Pacific coast of South America seems to be the source for the founders of P. gilberti. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Methodological congruence in phylogenomic analyses with morphological
   support for teiid lizards (Sauria: Teiidae)
SO MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION
AB A well-known issue in phylogenetics is discordance among gene trees, species trees, morphology, and other data types. Gene-tree discordance is often caused by incomplete lineage sorting, lateral gene transfer, and gene duplication. Multispecies-coalescent methods can account for incomplete lineage sorting and are believed by many to be more accurate than concatenation. However, simulation studies and empirical data have demonstrated that concatenation and species tree methods often recover similar topologies. We use three popular methods of phylogenetic reconstruction (one concatenation, two species tree) to evaluate relationships within Teiidae. These lizards are distributed across the United States to Argentina and the West Indies, and their classification has been controversial due to incomplete sampling and the discordance among various character types (chromosomes, DNA, musculature, osteology, etc.) used to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships. Recent morphological and molecular analyses of the group resurrected three genera and created five new genera to resolve non-monophyly in three historically ill-defined genera: Ameiva, Cnemidophorus, and Tupinambis. Here, we assess the phylogenetic relationships of the Teiidae using "next-generation" anchored-phylogenomics sequencing. Our final alignment includes 316 loci (488,656 bp DNA) for 244 individuals (56 species of teiids, representing all currently recognized genera) and all three methods (ExaML, MP-EST, and ASTRAL-II) recovered essentially identical topologies. Our results are basically in agreement with recent results from morphology and smaller molecular datasets, showing support for monophyly of the eight new genera. Interestingly, even with hundreds of loci, the relationships among some genera in Tupinambinae remain ambiguous (i.e. low nodal support for the position of Salvator and Dracaena).

TI Phylogeny and temporal diversification of the New World pond turtles
   (Emydidae)
SO MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION
AB We present a comprehensive multigene phylogeny and time tree for the turtle family Emydidae. Our phylogenetic analysis, based on 30 nuclear and four mitochondrial genes (23,330 total base pairs) sequenced for two individuals for each of the currently recognized species of the subfamily Emydinae and two species from each of the more species-rich Deirochelyinae genera, yielded a well-supported tree that provides an evolutionary framework for this well-studied Glade and a basis for a stable taxonomy. We calibrated an emydid time tree using three well-vetted fossils, modeled uncertainty in fossil ages to reflect their accuracy in node dating, and extracted stem/crown ages of a number of key diversification events. We date the age of crown emydids at a relatively young 44 Ma, and the crown age of both contained subfamilies at roughly 30 Ma. One deirochelyine Glade, which includes the genera Graptemys, Malaclemys, Pseudemys, and Trachemys and contains 11% of all turtle species, dates to 21 Ma just prior to the mid-Miocene climatic optimum, suggesting a potential causal link between warm, moist conditions and rapid species accumulation of these highly aquatic turtles. Both nuclear DNA data alone and in combination with mitochondria] DNA support the monophyly of an inclusive genus Emys containing the old world species orbicularis and trinacris and the New World blandingii, marmorata and pallida. Given that all members of this group were originally aligned in the genus Emys and that the age of the Glade is roughly equal to other emydine genera, we strongly support a classification that places these five species in a single genus rather than the alternative three-genus scheme (Emys (orbicularis, trinacris), Actinemys (marmorata, pallida), Emydoidea (blandingii)). The phylogeny and resulting time tree presented here provides a comprehensive foundation for future comparative analyses of the Emydidae that will shed light on the historical ecology and conservation prioritization of this diverse chelonian Glade.

TI Cophylogenetic analysis of New World ground-doves (Ayes: Columbidae) and
   their parasitic wing lice (Insecta: Phthiraptera: Columbicola)
SO MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION
AB Hosts-parasite interactions are plentiful and diverse, and understanding the patterns of these interactions can provide great insight into the evolutionary history of the organisms involved. Estimating the phylogenetic relationships of a group of parasites and comparing them to that of their hosts can indicate how factors such as host or parasite life history, biogeography, or climate affect evolutionary patterns. In this study we compare the phylogeny generated for a Glade of parasitic chewing lice (Insecta: Phthiraptera) within the genus Columbicola to that of their hosts, the small New World ground-doves (Ayes: Columbidae). We sampled lice from the majority of host species, including samples from multiple geographic locations. From these samples we sequenced mitochondrial and nuclear loci for the lice, and used these data to estimate phylogenetic trees and population networks. After estimating the appropriate number of operational taxonomic units (OTU5) for the lice, we used cophylogenetic analyses to compare the louse phylogeny to an existing host phylogeny. Our phylogenetic analysis recovered significant structure within the louse Glade, including evidence for potentially cryptic species. All cophylogenetic analyses indicated an overall congruence between the host and parasite trees. However, we only recovered a single cospeciation event. This finding suggests that certain branches in the trees are driving the signal of congruence. In particular, lice with the highest levels of congruence are associated with high Andean species of ground-doves that are well separated altitudinally from other related taxa. Other host-parasite associations are not as congruent, and these often involved widespread louse taxa. These widespread lice did, however, have significant phylogeographic structure, and their phylogenetic relationships are perhaps best explained by biogeographic patterns. Overall these results indicate that both host phylogeny and biogeography can be simultaneously important in influencing the patterns of diversification of parasites. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

TI An evaluation of logic regression-based biomarker discovery across
   multiple intergenic regions for predicting host specificity in
   Escherichia coli
SO MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION
AB Several studies have demonstrated that E. coli appears to display some level of host adaptation and specificity. Recent studies in our laboratory support these findings as determined by logic regression modeling of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in intergenic regions (ITGRs). We sought to determine the degree of host-specific information encoded in various ITGRs across a library of animal E. coli isolates using both whole genome analysis and a targeted ITGR sequencing approach. Our findings demonstrated that ITGRs across the genome encode various degrees of host-specific information. Incorporating multiple ITGRs (i.e., concatenation) into logic regression model building resulted in greater host-specificity and sensitivity outcomes in biomarkers, but the overall level of polymorphism in an ITGR did not correlate with the degree of host-specificity encoded in the ITGR. This suggests that distinct SNPs in ITGRs may be more important in defining host-specificity than overall sequence variation, explaining why traditional unsupervised learning phylogenetic approaches may be less informative in terms of revealing host-specific information encoded in DNA sequence. In silico analysis of 80 candidate ITGRs from publically available E. coli genomes was performed as a tool for discovering highly host-specific ITGRs. In one ITGR (ydeR-yedS) we identified a SNP biomarker that was 98% specific for cattle and for which 92% of all E. coli isolates originating from cattle carried this unique biomarker. In the case of humans, a host-specific biomarker (98% specificity) was identified in the concatenated ITGR sequences of rcsD-ompC, ydeR-yedS, and rclR-ykgE, and for which 78% of E. coli originating from humans carried this biomarker. Interestingly, human-specific biomarkers were dominant in ITGRs regulating antibiotic resistance, whereas in cattle host-specific biomarkers were found in ITGRs involved in stress regulation. These data suggest that evolution towards host specificity may be driven by different natural selection pressures on the regulome of E. coli among different animal hosts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

TI Molecular phylogenetics and diversification of trap jaw ants in the
   genera Anochetus and Odontomachus (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)
SO MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION
AB Ants in the genera Anochetus and Odontomachus belong to one of the largest clades in the subfamily Ponerinae, and are one of four lineages of ants possessing spring-loaded "trap -jaws." Here we present results from the first global species-level molecular phylogenetic analysis of these trap jaw ants, reconstructed from one mitochondria], one ribosomal RNA, and three nuclear protein-coding genes. Bayesian and likelihood analyses strongly support reciprocal monophyly for the genera Anochetus and Odontomachus. Additionally, we found strong support for seven trap-jaw ant clades (four in Anochetus and three in Odontomachus) mostly concordant with geographic distribution. Ambiguity remains concerning the closest living non-trap-jaw ant relative of the Anochetus + Odontomachus Glade, but Bayes factor hypothesis testing strongly suggests that trap jaw ants evolved from a short mandible ancestor. Ponerine trap jaw ants originated in the early Eocene (52.5 Mya) in either South America or Southeast Asia, where they have radiated rapidly in the last 30 million years, and subsequently dispersed multiple times to Africa and Australia. These results will guide future taxonomic work on the group and act as a phylogenetic framework to study the macroevolution of extreme ant mouthpart specialization. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

TI Phylogeographic analyses reveal Transpontic long distance dispersal in
   land snails belonging to the Caucasotachea atrolabiata complex
   (Gastropoda: Helicidae)
SO MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION
AB The phylogeography and population structure of land snails belonging to the Caucasotachea atrolabiata complex in the Caucasus region was investigated to obtain a better understanding of diversification processes in this biodiversity hotspot. So far the complex has been classified into three species, C. atrolabiata from the north-western Caucasus, C calligera from Transcaucasia and C intercedens from the eastern Pontus Mountains. Phylogenetic (neighbor-net and neighbor-joining tree) as well as admixture analyses based on AFLP data showed that the complex consists of two population clusters corresponding to C. atrolabiata and C calligera. The populations assigned to C intercedens in fact represent hybrids consisting of different proportions of the genomes of C. atrolabiata and C calligera. There is a broad transition zone between C atrolabiata and C calligera in the Pontic Mountains and a second transition zone in Abkhazia. Because of evidence for gene flow, it is suggested to classify the two aforementioned taxa as subspecies, namely C a. atrolabiata and C. a. calligera. The presence of mitochondrial C a. atrolabiata haplotypes in Turkey can only be explained by passive dispersal across the Black Sea. The distribution of C. a. atrolabiata and additional cases of land snails with disjunct Transpontic distribution patterns cannot be ascribed to a common cause but are results of long distance dispersal events at different times.

TI Integrating multiple evidences in taxonomy: species diversity and
   phylogeny of mustached bats (Mormoopidae: Pteronotus)
SO MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION
AB A phylogenetic systematic perspective is instrumental in recovering new species and their evolutionary relationships. The advent of new technologies for molecular and morphological data acquisition and analysis, allied to the integration of knowledge from different areas, such as ecology and population genetics, allows for the emergence of more rigorous, accurate and complete scientific hypothesis on species diversity. Mustached bats (genus Pteronotus) are a good model for the application of this integrative approach. They are a widely distributed and a morphologically homogeneous group, but comprising species with remarkable differences in their echolocation strategy and feeding behavior. The latest systematic review suggested six species with 17 subspecies in Pteronotus. Subsequent studies using discrete morphological characters supported the same arrangement. However, recent papers reported high levels of genetic divergence among conspecific taxa followed by bioacoustic and geographic agreement, suggesting an underestimated diversity in the genus. To date, no study merging genetic evidences and morphometric variation along the entire geographic range of this group has been attempted. Based on a comprehensive sampling including representatives of all current taxonomic units, we attempt to delimit species in Pteronotus through the application of multiple methodologies and hierarchically distinct datasets. The molecular approach includes six molecular markers from three genetic transmission systems; morphological investigations used 41 euclidean distances estimated through three-dimensional landmarks collected from 1628 skulls. The phylogenetic analysis reveals a greater diversity than previously reported, with a high correspondence among the genetic lineages and the currently recognized subspecies in the genus. Discriminant analysis of variables describing size and shape of cranial bones support the rising of the genetic groups to the specific status. Based on multiples evidences, we present an updated taxonomic arrangement composed by 16 extant species and a new and more robust phylogenetic hypothesis for the species included in the genus Pteronotus. Studies developed under such integrative taxonomic approach are timely for a deeper and wider comprehension of Neotropical diversity, representing the first step for answering broader questions on evolutionary and ecological aspects of Neotropical life history.

TI Optimal tree packing for discretized live rate-adaptive streaming in CDN
SO MULTIMEDIA SYSTEMS
AB Rate-adaptive streaming technologies, such as the Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) standard, provides an efficient and easy solution to stream multimedia in a heterogenous context. However, it reinforces the streaming capacity problem in the core Content Delivery Network (CDN) infrastructure since delivering one video means delivering an aggregation of multiple representations. In particular, for live rate-adaptive streaming, a large set of non-divisible data streams need to be either delivered in whole, or not delivered at all. Previous theoretical models that deal with streaming capacity problems are based on elastic bit rates, and do not capture these emerging features faced by today's CDNs. In this paper, we identify a new, discretized streaming model, for live rate-adaptive video delivery in CDNs. For this model we formulate a general optimization problem and show that it is NP-complete. Then we study two fundamental scenarios that occur in real CDNs. For each of these scenarios, we present a fast, easy to implement, and near-optimal algorithm with performance approximation ratios that are negligible for large networks. These are the first sets of results for the discretized streaming model, and have both practical and theoretical importance in a topic that has become critical.

TI A remote sensing image classification method based on sparse
   representation
SO MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
AB With the development of remote sensing image applications, sparse-based representation classification approaches have been investigated for better classification accuracy. This paper introduces an improved classification method based on sparse representation by representing the test samples through a dictionary. The key components of our proposed method rely on the feature dictionary construction, sparse representation and image reconstruction. The dictionary is obtained by training samples according to their class for a sparse linear combination. The sparse representation for the image is expressed as sparse coefficients by solving an optimization problem. We describe the method of constructing a dictionary by computing a best matrix to represent all data vectors. We also describe the algorithm used to solve for the sparse representation. Finally, we discuss the way of using the sparse vector to reconstruct the image for classification. In the experiments, the proposed method is applied to two real high spatial resolution images for the classification in comparison to Backpropagation Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, Classification and Regression Trees and K-means. The experimental results show that the proposed method performs better than the benchmark methods in terms of classification accuracy.

TI Automated Neuron Tracing Methods: An Updated Account
SO NEUROINFORMATICS
AB The reconstruction of neuron morphology allows to investigate how the brain works, which is one of the foremost challenges in neuroscience. This process aims at extracting the neuronal structures from microscopic imaging data. The great advances in microscopic technologies have made a huge amount of data available at the micro-, or even lower, resolution where manual inspection is time consuming, prone to error and utterly impractical. This has motivated the development of methods to automatically trace the neuronal structures, a task also known as neuron tracing. This paper surveys the latest neuron tracing methods available in the scientific literature as well as a selection of significant older papers to better place these proposals into context. They are categorized into global processing, local processing and meta-algorithm approaches. Furthermore, we point out the algorithmic components used to design each method and we report information on the datasets and the performance metrics used.

TI Neuron-Miner: An Advanced Tool for Morphological Search and Retrieval in
   Neuroscientific Image Databases
SO NEUROINFORMATICS
AB The steadily growing amounts of digital neuroscientific data demands for a reliable, systematic, and computationally effective retrieval algorithm. In this paper, we present Neuron-Miner, which is a tool for fast and accurate reference-based retrieval within neuron image databases. The proposed algorithm is established upon hashing (search and retrieval) technique by employing multiple unsupervised random trees, collectively called as Hashing Forests (HF). The HF are trained to parse the neuromorphological space hierarchically and preserve the inherent neuron neighborhoods while encoding with compact binary codewords. We further introduce the inverse-coding formulation within HF to effectively mitigate pairwise neuron similarity comparisons, thus allowing scalability to massive databases with little additional time overhead. The proposed hashing tool has superior approximation of the true neuromorphological neighborhood with better retrieval and ranking performance in comparison to existing generalized hashing methods. This is exhaustively validated by quantifying the results over 31266 neuron reconstructions from Neuromorpho.org dataset curated from 147 different archives. We envisage that finding and ranking similar neurons through reference-based querying via Neuron Miner would assist neuroscientists in objectively understanding the relationship between neuronal structure and function for applications in comparative anatomy or diagnosis.

TI Rivulet: 3D Neuron Morphology Tracing with Iterative Back-Tracking
SO NEUROINFORMATICS
AB The digital reconstruction of single neurons from 3D confocal microscopic images is an important tool for understanding the neuron morphology and function. However the accurate automatic neuron reconstruction remains a challenging task due to the varying image quality and the complexity in the neuronal arborisation. Targeting the common challenges of neuron tracing, we propose a novel automatic 3D neuron reconstruction algorithm, named Rivulet, which is based on the multi-stencils fast-marching and iterative back-tracking. The proposed Rivulet algorithm is capable of tracing discontinuous areas without being interrupted by densely distributed noises. By evaluating the proposed pipeline with the data provided by the Diadem challenge and the recent BigNeuron project, Rivulet is shown to be robust to challenging microscopic imagestacks. We discussed the algorithm design in technical details regarding the relationships between the proposed algorithm and the other state-of-the-art neuron tracing algorithms.

TI Dendritic and Axonal Wiring Optimization of Cortical GABAergic
   Interneurons
SO NEUROINFORMATICS
AB The way in which a neuronal tree expands plays an important role in its functional and computational characteristics. We aimed to study the existence of an optimal neuronal design for different types of cortical GABAergic neurons. To do this, we hypothesized that both the axonal and dendritic trees of individual neurons optimize brain connectivity in terms of wiring length. We took the branching points of real three-dimensional neuronal reconstructions of the axonal and dendritic trees of different types of cortical interneurons and searched for the minimal wiring arborization structure that respects the branching points. We compared the minimal wiring arborization with real axonal and dendritic trees. We tested this optimization problem using a new approach based on graph theory and evolutionary computation techniques. We concluded that neuronal wiring is near-optimal in most of the tested neurons, although the wiring length of dendritic trees is generally nearer to the optimum. Therefore, wiring economy is related to the way in which neuronal arborizations grow irrespective of the marked differences in the morphology of the examined interneurons.

TI Mid- and Late Holocene vegetation dynamics and fire history in the
   boreal forest of European Russia: A case study from Meshchera Lowlands
SO PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
AB Climate, fire, and human activities strongly affected the development of vegetation communities during the Holocene, yet the relative importance of these individual factors remains unclear in many areas. This paper presents new multi-proxy records of environmental change for the Meshchera Lowlands (the central part of the East European Plain) during the Holocene. Changes in regional vegetation during the Mid- and Late Holocene were influenced by climate, fire regime and human impact, as indicated by pollen, plant macrofossil, charcoal and testate amoebae analysis from several peat cores, along with reconstruction of tree cover from pollen assemblages. Since 8500 cal yr BP, the vegetation history represented a series of consecutive phases of birch, birch -pine and pine-broadleaf forests, with introduction of spruce after 2500 cal yr BP. Maximal abundance of broadleaf tree species was detected from 4700 to 2000 cal yr BP. Vegetation dynamics were strongly influenced by human activity since 1400 cal yr BP. High fire frequency was recorded for the periods 8500-4500 cal yr BP and 35002000 cal yr BP, when the fire return interval varied from 40 to 80 years. Since 2000 cal yr BP, the fire return period exceeded 500 years suggesting a significant decline in fire frequency during the last two millennia. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Pinworm diversity in free-ranging howler monkeys (Alouatta spp.) in
   Mexico: Morphological and molecular evidence for two new Trypanoxyuris
   species (Nematoda: Oxyuridae)
SO PARASITOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
AB Two new species of Trypanoxyuris are described from the intestine of free-ranging howler monkeys in Mexico, Trypanoxyuris multilabiatus n. sp. from the mantled howler Alouatta palliate, and Trypanoxyuris pigrae n. sp. from the black howler Alouatta pigra. An integrative taxonomic approach is followed, where conspicuous morphological traits and phylogenetic trees based on DNA sequences are used to test the validity of the two new species. The mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 gene, and the nuclear ribosomal 185 and 28S rRNA genes were used for evolutionary analyses, with the concatenated dataset of all three genes used for maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses. The two new species of pinworms from howler monkeys were morphologically distinct and formed reciprocally monophyletic lineages in molecular phylogenetic trees. The three species from howler monkeys, T. multilabiatus n. sp., T. pigrae n. sp., and Trypanoxyuris minutus, formed a monophyletic group with high bootstrap and posterior probability support values. Phylogenetic patterns inferred from sequence data support the hypothesis of a close evolutionary association between these primate hosts and their pinworm parasites. The results suggest that the diversity of pinworm parasites from Neotropical primates might be underestimated. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Review of anthraquinone applications for pest management and
   agricultural crop protection
SO PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
AB We have reviewed published anthraquinone applications for international pest management and agricultural crop protection from 1943 to 2016. Anthraquinone (AQ) is commonly found in dyes, pigments and many plants and organisms. Avian repellent research with AQ began in the 1940s. In the context of pest management, AQ is currently used as a chemical repellent, perch deterrent, insecticide and feeding deterrent in many wild birds, and in some mammals, insects and fishes. Criteria for evaluation of effective chemical repellents include efficacy, potential for wildlife hazards, phytotoxicity and environmental persistence. As a biopesticide, AQ often meets these criteria of efficacy for the non-lethal management of agricultural depredation caused by wildlife. We summarize published applications of AQ for the protection of newly planted and maturing crops from pest birds. Conventional applications of AQ-based repellents include preplant seed treatments [e.g. corn (Zea mays L.), rice (Oryza sativa L.), sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), wheat (Triticum spp.), millet (Panicum spp.), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.), pelletized feed and forest tree species] and foliar applications for rice, sunflower, lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), turf, sugar beets (Beta vulgaris L.), soybean (Glycine max L.), sweet corn and nursery, fruit and nut crops. In addition to agricultural repellent applications, AQ has also been used to treat toxicants for the protection of non-target birds. Few studies have demonstrated AQ repellency in mammals, including wild boar (Sus scrofa, L.), thirteen-lined ground squirrels (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus, Mitchill), black-tailed prairie dogs (Cyomys ludovicainus, Ord.), common voles (Microtus arvalis, Pallas), house mice (Mus musculus, L.), Tristram's jirds (Meriones tristrami, Thomas) and black rats (Rattus rattus L.). Natural sources of AQ and its derivatives have also been identified as insecticides and insect repellents. As a natural or synthetic biopesticide, AQ is a promising candidate for many contexts of non-lethal and insecticidal pest management. Published 2016.

TI Foliar application of microdoses of sucrose to reduce codling moth Cydia
   pomonella L. (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) damage to apple trees
SO PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
AB BACKGROUNDThe effects of foliar applications of microdoses of sucrose to reduce the damage by the codling moth have been reported from nine trials carried in France and Algeria from 2009 to 2014. The activity of sucrose alone was assessed by comparison with an untreated control and some treatments with the Cydia pomonella granulovirus or a chemical insecticide. The addition of sucrose to these different treatments was also investigated.
   RESULTSThe application of sucrose at 0.01% reduced the means of infested fruits with a value of Abbott's efficacy of 41.0 10.0%. This involved the induction of resistance by antixenosis to insect egg laying. Indeed, it seems that acceptance of egg laying on leaves treated with sucrose was reduced. The addition of sucrose to thiacloprid improved its efficacy (59.5% +/- 12.8) by 18.4%. However, the sucrose had no added value when associated with C. pomonella granulovirus treatments.
   CONCLUSIONFoliar applications of microdoses of sucrose every 20 days in commercial orchards can partially protect against the codling moth. Its addition to thiacloprid increases the efficacy in integrated control strategies, contrary to C. pomonella granulovirus treatments. This work opens a route for the development of new biocontrol strategies. (c) 2016 Society of Chemical Industry

TI Apparent electrical conductivity measurements in an olive orchard under
   wet and dry soil conditions: significance for clay and soil water
   content mapping
SO PRECISION AGRICULTURE
AB Mediterranean olive trees traditionally grow under rainfed conditions, on poor soils with steep slopes. Rainfall is mainly concentrated during autumn and winter and is characterized by intense rain pulses, separated by dry periods. The use of electromagnetic induction (EMI) techniques in these olive orchards might be questioned since EMI surveys are generally recommended to be performed under moist soil conditions. A 6.7 ha olive orchard was surveyed for EMI-based apparent electrical conductivity (ECa), both under wet and dry soil conditions. In addition, 48 soil samples were analyzed for soil texture and for soil water content (SWC) under both soil conditions. The relationships between ECa, soil texture and SWC, under both soil conditions were evaluated. Despite the significantly larger ECa values measured during the wet survey as compared to the dry survey, a similar spatial correlation structure was found, indicating temporally stable ECa patterns. Significant correlations (r) were found between both surveys for ECa (r = 0.67) and for SWC (r = 0.63). The correlation between SWC and clay content exceeded 0.60 for both surveys, and the correlation between ECa and clay content was twice as high under wet soil conditions as compared to dry soil. In both situations, the ECa surveys revealed the same patterns of soil texture, indicating that moist soil conditions are not an absolute prerequisite for the use of EMI to map the spatial variability of these soil properties. Nonetheless, measuring the ECa under different moisture conditions can provide additional information about soil moisture dynamics.

AB Lightning is one of the most frequent accident causes in storage tank parks, and accidents triggered by lightning are the most frequent Natech event reported in past-accident analysis. In the present study, a methodology for the inclusion of accidents triggered by lightning in Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA) was developed. A model for the assessment of lightning impact probability on process equipment and specific equipment vulnerability models were coupled to dedicated event trees, allowing the quantification of risk indexes. The methodology developed also allows the assessment of risk reduction by the implementation of different lightning protection strategies. The results obtained represent a step forward towards the introduction of risk-based design of lightning protection systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Advanced RESTART method for the estimation of the probability of failure
   of highly reliable hybrid dynamic systems
SO RELIABILITY ENGINEERING & SYSTEM SAFETY
AB The efficient estimation of system reliability characteristics is of paramount importance for many engineering applications. Real world system reliability modeling calls for the capability of treating systems that are: i) dynamic, ii) complex, iii) hybrid and iv) highly reliable. Advanced Monte Carlo (MC) methods offer a way to solve these types of problems, which are feasible according to the potentially high computational costs. In this paper, the REpetitive Simulation Trials After Reaching Thresholds (RESTART) method is employed, extending it to hybrid systems for the first time (to the authors' knowledge). The estimation accuracy and precision of RESTART highly depend on the choice of the Importance Function (IF) indicating how close the system is to failure: in this respect, proper IFs are here originally proposed to improve the performance of RESTART for the analysis of hybrid systems. The resulting overall simulation approach is applied to estimate the probability of failure of the control system of a liquid hold-up tank and of a pump-valve subsystem subject to degradation induced by fatigue. The results are compared to those obtained by standard MC simulation and by RESTART with classical IFs available in the literature. The comparison shows the improvement in the performance obtained by our approach. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Modeling and forecasting hourly global solar radiation using clustering
   and classification techniques
SO SOLAR ENERGY
AB A new system to forecast and model hourly global solar radiation is proposed. The system works in two different phases and applies different data mining techniques in each phase. A clustering algorithm to identify the type of days is proposed. The use of decision trees, artificial neural networks and support vector machines to estimate the parameters that characterize each type of day is also advanced. Two procedures are put forward to analyze data and estimate models. The proposed procedures have been validated using data recorded in Malaga, Spain. Two different input data sets were used and the corresponding errors for each case are presented. The results show that it is possible to predict next-day hourly values of solar radiation values with an rMAE of 15.2% for one of the input data sets; while the rMAE is 16.7% for the other input parameter set.

   One peak for each target carbohydrate was obtained by using an efficient derivatization employing methylboronic acid and acetic anhydride sequentially, whereas the baseline separation of the analytes was accomplished using an ionic liquid capillary column. First, the proposed method was optimized and validated. Successively, it was applied to identify the carbohydrates present in plant material. Finally, the procedure was successfully applied to samples from a XVII century painting, thus highlighting the occurrence of starch glue and fruit tree gum as polysaccharide materials.

TI A streaming flow-based technique for traffic classification applied to
   12+1 years of Internet traffic
SO TELECOMMUNICATION SYSTEMS
AB The continuous evolution of Internet traffic and its applications makes the classification of network traffic a topic far from being completely solved. An essential problem in this field is that most of proposed techniques in the literature are based on a static view of the network traffic (i.e., they build a model or a set of patterns from a static, invariable dataset). However, very little work has addressed the practical limitations that arise when facing a more realistic scenario with an infinite, continuously evolving stream of network traffic flows. In this paper, we propose a streaming flow-based classification solution based on Hoeffding Adaptive Tree, a machine learning technique specifically designed for evolving data streams. The main novelty of our proposal is that it is able to automatically adapt to the continuous evolution of the network traffic without storing any traffic data. We apply our solution to a 12 + 1 year-long dataset from a transit link in Japan, and show that it can sustain a very high accuracy over the years, with significantly less cost and complexity than existing alternatives based on static learning algorithms, such as C4.5.

TI Composite time-consistent multi-period risk measure and its application
   in optimal portfolio selection
SO TOP
AB Through the composition of two real-valued functions, we propose a new class of multi-period risk measure which is time consistent. The new multi-period risk measure is monotonous and convex when the two real-valued functions satisfy monotonicity and convexity. Based on this generic framework, we construct a specific class of time-consistent multi-period risk measure by considering the lower partial moment between the realized wealth and the target wealth at individual periods. With the new multi-period risk measure as the objective function, we formulate a multi-period portfolio selection model by considering transaction costs at individual investment periods. Furthermore, this stochastic programming model is transformed into a deterministic programming problem using the scenario tree technology. Finally, we show through empirical tests and comparisons the rationality, practicality and efficiency of our new multi-period risk measure and the corresponding portfolio selection model.

TI Exploiting SSDs in operational multiversion databases
SO VLDB JOURNAL
AB Multiversion databases store both current and historical data. Rows are typically annotated with timestamps representing the period when the row is/was valid. We develop novel techniques to reduce index maintenance in multiversion databases, so that indexes can be used effectively for analytical queries over current data without being a heavy burden on transaction throughput. To achieve this end, we re-design persistent index data structures in the storage hierarchy to employ an extra level of indirection. The indirection level is stored on solid-state disks that can support very fast random I/Os, so that traversing the extra level of indirection incurs a relatively small overhead. The extra level of indirection dramatically reduces the number of magnetic disk I/Os that are needed for index updates and localizes maintenance to indexes on updated attributes. Additionally, we batch insertions within the indirection layer in order to reduce physical disk I/Os for indexing new records. In this work, we further exploit SSDs by introducing novel DeltaBlock techniques for storing the recent changes to data on SSDs. Using our DeltaBlock, we propose an efficient method to periodically flush the recently changed data from SSDs to HDDs such that, on the one hand, we keep track of every change (or delta) for every record, and, on the other hand, we avoid redundantly storing the unchanged portion of updated records. By reducing the index maintenance overhead on transactions, we enable operational data stores to create more indexes to support queries. We have developed a prototype of our indirection proposal by extending the widely used generalized search tree open-source project, which is also employed in PostgreSQL. Our working implementation demonstrates that we can significantly reduce index maintenance and/or query processing cost by a factor of 3. For the insertion of new records, our novel batching technique can save up to 90 % of the insertion time. For updates, our prototype demonstrates that we can significantly reduce the database size by up to 80 % even with a modest space allocated for DeltaBlocks on SSDs.

TI Read/write-optimized tree indexing for solid-state drives
SO VLDB JOURNAL
AB Flash-memory-based solid-state drives (SSDs) are used widely for secondary storage. To be effective for SSDs, traditional indices have to be redesigned to cope with the special properties of flash memory, such as asymmetric read/write latencies (fast reads and slow writes) and out-of-place updates. Previous flash-optimized indices focus mainly on reducing random writes to SSDs, which is typically accomplished at the expense of a substantial number of extra reads. However, modern SSDs show a narrowing gap between read and write speeds, and read operations on SSDs increasingly affect the overall performance of indices on SSDs. As a consequence, how to optimize SSD-aware indices by reducing both write and read costs is a pertinent and open challenge. We propose a new tree index for SSDs that is able to reduce both writes and extra reads. In particular, we use an update buffer and overflow pages to reduce random writes, and we further exploit Bloom filters to reduce the extra reads to the overflow nodes in the tree. With this mechanism, we construct a read/write-optimized index that is capable of offering better overall performance than previous flash-aware indices. In addition, we present an analysis of the proposed index and show that the read and write costs of the operations on the index can be balanced by only tuning the false-positive rate of the Bloom filters. Our experimental results suggest that our proposal is efficient and represents an improvement over existing methods.

TI Clustering in non-parametric multivariate analyses
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY
AB Non-parametric multivariate analyses of complex ecological datasets are widely used. Following appropriate pretreatment of the data inter-sample resemblances are calculated using appropriate measures. Ordination and clustering derived from these resemblances are used to visualise relationships among samples (or variables). Hierarchical agglomerative clustering with group-average (UPGMA) linkage is often the clustering method chosen. Using an example dataset of zooplankton densities from the Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary, UK, a range of existing and new clustering methods are applied and the results compared. Although the examples focus on analysis of samples, the methods may also be applied to species analysis. Dendrograms derived by hierarchical clustering are compared using cophenetic correlations, which are also used to determine optimum beta in flexible beta clustering. A plot of cophenetic correlation against original dissimilarities reveals that a tree may be a poor representation of the full multivariate information. UNCTREE is an unconstrained binary divisive clustering algorithm in which values of the ANOSIM R statistic are used to determine (binary) splits in the data, to form a dendrogram. A form of flat clustering, k-R clustering, uses a combination of ANOSIM R and Similarity Profiles (SIMPROF) analyses to determine the optimum value of k, the number of groups into which samples should be clustered, and the sample membership of the groups. Robust outcomes from the application of such a range of differing techniques to the same resemblance matrix, as here, result in greater confidence in the validity of a clustering approach.

TI Identification of differentially expressed genes and signalling pathways
   in bark of Hevea brasiliensis seedlings associated with secondary
   laticifer differentiation using gene expression microarray
SO PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY
AB The natural rubber of Para rubber tree, Hevea brasiliensis, is the main crop involved in industrial rubber production due to its superior quality. The Hevea bark is commercially exploited to obtain latex, which is produced from the articulated secondary laticifer. The laticifer is well defined in the aspect of morphology; however, only some genes associated with its development have been reported. We successfully induced secondary laticifer in the jasmonic acid (JA)-treated and linolenic acid (LA)-treated Hevea bark but secondary laticifer is not observed in the ethephon (ET)-treated and untreated Hevea bark. In this study, we analysed 27,195 gene models using NimbleGen microarrays based on the Hevea draft genome. 491 filtered differentially expressed (FDE) transcripts that are common to both JA- and LA treated bark samples but not ET-treated bark samples were identified. In the Eukaryotic Orthologous Group (KOG) analysis, 491 FDE transcripts belong to different functional categories that reflect the diverse processes and pathways involved in laticifer differentiation. In the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and KOG analysis, the profile of the FDE transcripts suggest that JA- and LA-treated bark samples have a sufficient molecular basis for secondary laticifer differentiation, especially regarding secondary metabolites metabolism. FDE genes in this category are from the cytochrome (CYP) P450 family, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, or cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) family. The data includes many genes involved in cell division, cell wall synthesis, and cell differentiation. The most abundant transcript in FDE list was SDR65C, reflecting its importance in laticifer differentiation. Using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) as part of annotation and functional prediction, several characterised as well as uncharacterized transcription factors and genes were found in the dataset. Hence, the further characterization of these genes is necessary to unveil their role in laticifer differentiation. This study provides a platform for the further characterization and identification of the key genes involved in secondary laticifer differentiation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI Effect of exogenous GA(3) and its inhibitor paclobutrazol on floral
   formation, endogenous hormones, and flowering-associated genes in 'Fuji'
   apple (Malus domestica Borkh.)
SO PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Gibberellins (GM) reduce apple (Malus domestica) flowering rates; however, the mechanism of their action is not fully understood. To gain a better insight into gibberellin-regulated flowering, here, 5 year old 'Fuji' apple trees were used to explore the responses of hormones [GA(1+3),GA(4+7), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), zeatin-riboside (ZR), and abscisic acid (ABA)], and gibberellin- and flowering-associated genes, to applications of gibberellin acid (GA(3)) and paclobutrazol (PAC). Results showed that GA(3) relatively stimulated vegetative growth and delayed floral induction. Moreover, GA(3) spraying significantly affected contents of all endogenous hormones and all the genes tested in at least one time points: the content of endogenous GAs was increased instantly and that of ZR was reduced at 44 days after fullbloom (DAF), which might constitute an unfavorable factor for flower formation; MdKO (ent-kaurene oxidase gene) and MdGA20ox (GA20 oxidase gene) were significantly repressed by a high level of GM through the negative feedback regulation of GA; additionally, the MdSPLs (SQUAMOSA-PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE) in this study were all significantly repressed by GA(3) but promoted by PAC; the expression of MdFT1/2 (FLOWERING LOCUS T), MdSOC1 (SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1) and MdAP1 (APE-TALA1) in GA(3)-treated buds changed in the same way, and they were repressed at 44 DAF We suppose that GA(3) spraying disrupts the balance between ZR and GM, and inhibits floral induction, probably by suppressing MdSPLs and the floral integrators in flower induction, which ultimately contributed to inhibiting flower formation.

TI A new approach for obtaining trans-resveratrol from tree peony seed oil
   extracted residues using ionic liquid-based enzymatic hydrolysis in situ
   extraction
SO SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
AB A new approach for ionic liquid-based enzymatic hydrolysis in situ trans-resveratrol extraction (ILEHE) from tree peony seed oil extracted residues is presented, in which enzymatic hydrolysis is used in an ionic liquid aqueous medium to enhance the trans-resveratrol yield. Various factors of the ILEHE procedure, including the variety and concentration of enzyme, type and concentration of ionic liquid, liquid-solid ratio and pH of the solution system, and ILEHE temperature and time, were investigated by single-factor experiments, response surface methodology, and first-order kinetic models. A satisfactory yield of trans-resveratrol (5.48 +/- 0.14 mu mol/g) was obtained by the novel developed approach compared with other conventional techniques. Scanning electronic microscopy of the samples indicated that tree peony seed treated by mixed cellulase and pectinase (1/1, w/w) enzymes in an ionic liquid led to more efficient extraction by reducing mass transfer barrier. The proposed ILEHE method was validated by stability, repeatability, and recovery experiments and shows promising prospects in the extraction and hydrolysis aspects, for enhancing efficiency of target components in natural products.

TI Molecular detection, identification and phylogenetic inference of
   Leishmania spp. in some desert lizards from Northwest China by using
   internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) sequences
SO ACTA TROPICA
AB Leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania is still endemic in Northwest China. It has been thought that reptiles could be a reservoir for mammalian leishmaniasis. However, data are still scarce on natural infection of lizards with Leishmania spp. in China. The present study deals with detection, identification and phylogenetic inference of Leishmania parasites at species and intraspecies levels isolated from six desert lizard species from 10 geographical locations in Northwest China using amplification and sequencing of ITS-rDNA. In total, 83 haplotypes were found among 137 ITS1 sequences obtained from up to 64.6% of all captured lizards. Representative sequences of Leishmania available in GenBank were compiled for comparison with the obtained haplotypes. Tree-based species delimitation was achieved by using Bayesian phylogenitc analyses and maximum parsimony approach. Phylogenetic trees congruently supported that the haplotypes were found to belong to three Leishmania species including L. (sauroleishmania) sp., Leishmania tropica and Leishmania donovani complex. A network approach revealed paraphyletic populations of L. (sauroleishmania) sp. and L tropica at intraspecies level regarding geographical origin and low host specificity. Chinese L. tropica from lizards showed significant heterogeneity as the obtained haplotypes were distributed in different clusters from other countries. Common ancestry was observed between some sequences of L. tropica from lizards and other sequence types from clinical samples from other countries. This may lend support to the potential reservoir role of lizards for human leishmaniasis. Our results appear to be the first molecular evidence for natural infection of lizards in Northwest China with reptilian Leishmania and mammalian Leishmania species. Desert lizards may be considered as putative reservoir hosts for Leishmania in China. Further studies on persistence of the Leishmania parasites in lizards and sandflies are recommended for the better understanding of their epidemiological involvement. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI Investigation of correlativity between heavy metals concentration in
   indigenous plants and combined pollution soils
SO CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY
AB The accumulation of heavy metals (HMs) in soils is potentially hazardous to human, livestock and plant species. HMs in the combined pollution soils and indigenous plants were investigated in a non-ferrous metal-smelting area. The purpose of this study was to determine the HMs in the contaminated soil and different plant species found growing on it, as well as calculation of bioaccumulation coefficients (BACs). Representative sampling sites were identified according to the land-use types. A total of 12 surface soil samples and 32 plant samples were collected. HMs were analysed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The levels of soil pollution were assessed using Nemerow's synthetical contamination index method. The synthetical index was in the range of 16.81-198.11. This result indicated a heavy burden on local environment. HM concentrations in plants were directly related with soil concentrations. The average BACs of five metals were found in the order of Cd (0.309)>Zn (0.178)approximate to Pb (0.160)>Cu (0.105)>Sb (0.0672). Spontaneous weeds including Chenopodium album Linn, Kochia scoparia and trees of Leuce, Ulmus pumila were deemed HM accumulators. The results provided a practical basis for phytoremediation of HM-contaminated soils using accumulator species.

TI Investigation of spatial distributions and sources of persistent organic
   pollutants (POPs) in a heavily polluted industrial region using tree
   components
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB Spatial distributions of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) were investigated in Iskenderun industrial region in Turkey. POP concentrations were measured in different tree components (i.e., pine needle, branch, bark, and stem) collected at several industrial and background sites (n = 27). Also, air, litter, and soil samples were analyzed to determine the relationship of atmospheric pollutants with tree components, litter, and soil. Spatial variation of measured concentrations and factor analysis showed that the iron-steel plants are the most important POP sources in Iskenderun area. Correlations of ambient air levels to those measured in soil, litter, and tree components were significant showing that POPs are exchanged between atmosphere and these compartments. Results have suggested that tree components, litter and soil could be used to determine the spatial distributions and sources of atmospheric POPs in a region. POP quantities (mg/ha) accumulated in different tree components, litter, and soil were also predicted. Generally, the highest quantities were accumulated by stem and needles. In terms of overall inventory, including trees, litter and soil, the highest accumulated quantities were found in soil followed by trees and litter, indicating that in addition to soil, vegetation is a notable reservoir accumulating POPs. Ambient air POP concentrations were also estimated using a bark/air partitioning model. The estimated/measured ratios were close to 1.0 for several compounds and the results showed that the atmospheric POP concentrations could be estimated from the bark measurements within factors of 0.23-3.07,1.02-6.67, 0.63-7.44,1.07-3.37 for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, polychlorinated naphthalenes, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers, respectively.

TI Policy-based signature scheme from lattices
SO DESIGNS CODES AND CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB Policy-based signature, introduced by Bellare and Fuchsbauer at PKC 2014, is a new type of digital signature in which a signer is only allowed to sign messages satisfying certain policy specified by the authority, but the signatures should not reveal the underlying policy. Having these features, policy-based signatures are attractive from both theoretical and practical aspects. In their pioneering paper, Bellare and Fuchsbauer have provided generic constructions of policy-based signatures, and a concrete instantiation based on pairings. In this work, we develop the recent techniques in lattice-based cryptography to construct a (delegatable) policy-based signature scheme from lattice assumptions. Specifically, we adapt Langlois et al.'s zero-knowledge argument system (PKC 2014) for the Bonsai tree signature scheme (Eurocrypt 2010) to enable the prover to convince the verifier that its secret witness satisfies an additional condition. Making the protocol non-interactive via the Fiat-Shamir transformation, we obtain a policy-based signature scheme supporting polynomially many policies, which satisfies the two security requirements (simulatability and extractability) in the random oracle model. Furthermore, our construction can be efficiently extended to a delegatable policy-based signature, thanks to the hierarchical structure of the Bonsai tree. Our contribution is twofold. On the one hand, we enrich the scope of policy-based signatures by providing the first quantum-resistant instantiation. On the other hand, our technical approach can potentially be applied to design a wide variety of privacy-enhanced lattice-based cryptographic constructions.

TI Tree species traits are the predominant control on the decomposition
   rate of tree log bark in a mesic old-growth boreal forest
SO FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB Decomposition of coarse woody debris (CWD) bark is characterized by complex and poorly understood dynamics with unclear implications for carbon and nutrient cycling and biodiversity. We examined changes in cover and physical parameters through decomposition of bark attached to logs of the main tree species in an old-growth middle boreal forest. In a 66 yrs long chronosequence after tree death and fall, we analyzed changes in the following parameters of log bark: cover, moisture, area-specific mass, total mass, dry bulk density, thickness and proportion of phloem. The percent of bark left on the sampled stems decreased with time since tree death and averaged 38%, 61% and 86% for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), Norway spruce (Picea abies), and silver and downy birch (Betula pubescens and Betula pendula) = aspen (Populus tremula), respectively. Bark moisture increased along with succession of epixylic vegetation on logs that progressed similarly for all studied tree species. On average, no vegetation was recorded on logs 3 yrs after tree death. In 9 yrs, logs were characterized by the first stage of sparse vegetation cover. The closed groups of the second stage, with cover of not less than 70%, consisted mainly of non-epigeous species, and developed an average of 19 yrs after tree death. The third stage was dominated by ground cryptogam species without a significant contribution of vascular plants, and the fourth stage, when the wood was completely overgrown by the establishment and spread of vascular plants, was observed and average of 30 yrs after tree death. The exponential rate of total mass loss of bark increased at rates of 0.068, 0.110, 0.197 and 0.312 yr(-1) for birch, aspen, spruce, and pine, respectively. The highest rate of bulk density loss was recorded for aspen (0.024 yr(-1)) and did not differ for birch, pine and spruce (0.009 yr(-1)). The decomposition rate was expressed as a rate of bark mass loss divided by initial volume (integrating losses due to bark mineralization, peeling, consumption by insects and sloughing from logs). It averaged 0.147 yr(-1) for birch, aspen and spruce and 0.291 yr(-1) for pine, independent of stem section, log diameter and decay class. In old-growth forests, where CWD volumes may reach hundreds of cubic meters, the accurate portrayal of bark decomposition patterns is crucial for estimating the role of CWD in carbon and nutrient cycles and the diversity of CWD-dependent organisms with different habitat requirements.

TI Carbon and nitrogen pools and mineralization rates in boreal forest soil
   after stump harvesting
SO FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB The use of forest-derived biomass has steadily increased in Finland and Sweden during the past decades leading to more intensive forest management practices in the region, such as whole-tree harvesting, both above- and belowground. Stump harvesting results in a direct removal of stump and coarse-root carbon (C) from the stand and can cause extensive soil disturbance, which has been suggested to increase C mineralization. In this study, the effects of stump harvesting on soil C and nitrogen (N) mineralization, and soil surface disturbance were studied in two different clear-felled Norway spruce (Picea abies) sites in Central Finland. The treatments were whole-tree harvesting (WTH, removal of stems and logging residues), and WTH and stump harvesting (WTH + S). Both sites, Honkola (2 stands) and Haukilahti (6 stands) were mounded. In both treatments, soil samples were taken from different soil layers down to a total depth of 20 cm in the mineral soil from (i) mounds, (ii) undisturbed soil and (iii) pits. The sampling was performed 11-12 years after treatments. Soil C and N mineralization rates were determined in laboratory incubation experiments. In addition, total C and N pools (g m(2)) were estimated for each disturbance class and soil layer. Soil C and N pools had a tendency to be lower following stump harvesting, but no statistically significant treatment effect was detected. Stump harvesting increased soil mixing as indicated by a significant decrease in C concentration in the mound disturbance class. There was no significant effect of stump harvesting on soil C mineralization rates. A combination of mineralization rates and soil pool data showed that field C mineralization (g CO2-C m(-2) yr(-1)) did not significantly differ between stands where stumps were removed or were retained. Further, stump harvesting did not seem to have any stimulating effect on soil CO2 efflux 11-12 years after treatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Spatial and demographic structure of tara stands (Caesalpinia spinosa)
   in Peru: Influence of present and past forest management
SO FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB Tropical dry forests are highly endangered ecosystems that have been scarcely studied. Many species within these forests suffer regeneration problems due to unsustainable management regimes. In particular, a regeneration problem has been detected in a forest of tara (Caesalpinia spinosa), a neotropical tree of high ecological and economic value, in Atiquipa (Peru). The study of the spatial patterns and population structure of forests can help us understand their dynamics and evaluate the effects of management. In this article, we analyse the stand demographic structure, spatial distribution and patterns of plant plant interactions in tara forests. We evaluate whether the regeneration problem in Atiquipa is strictly local or a problem of general concern and investigate the most probable causes. Four tara stands were selected at different localities in Peru. Two stands (Andurco and Polan) had a reverse J-shaped diametric structure, typical of stable self-replacing forests, although Polan had a low number of young trees, indicating an incipient regeneration problem. The Lloque histogram was skewed (with a maximum in seedlings <= 1 cm), indicating over-exploitation in the past and present forest regeneration. Maguey had a low number of regenerates, with peaks in some intermediate diametric classes, which may indicate natural regeneration problems or some past management. Spatial distribution of tara trees did not depart from the null model (approximate to random distribution), typical of trees dispersed by zoochory. Maguey was an exception, showing a regular pattern at short distances, possibly associated with past management (like selective cuttings and/or plantations). These results suggest that in most of the analysed stands the current forest management (i.e. excessive seed collection or grazing) limits tara forest regeneration. However, the only stand with a protected status presented a clear tendency toward population increase. Bivariate analyses revealed an aggregated pattern between seedlings and adult trees. Moreover, the plant-plant interaction study showed that seedlings were associated with woody vegetation. These positive associations highlight a facilitative effect that ameliorates stressful microclimatic characteristics and/or protects tara seedlings from herbivory. The results of this study support some recommendations for sustainable management, such as controlled stocking rate, limited seed collection and promotion of bush cover. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI Assessing spatial distribution, stand impacts and rate of Ceratocystis
   fimbriata induced 'ohi'a (Metrosideros polymorpha) mortality in a
   tropical wet forest, Hawai'i Island, USA
SO FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB Pests or pathogens that affect trees have the potential to fundamentally alter forest composition, structure and function. Throughout the last six years, large areas of otherwise healthy 'ohi'a (Metrosideros polymorpha) trees have been dying rapidly (typically within weeks) in lowland tropical wet forest on Hawai'i Island, USA. This mortality is quite distinct from previous well-documented 'ohi'a dieback episodes driven by cohort senescence. Ceratocystis fimbiata was identified and routinely found associated with rapidly dying individuals of 'ohi'a, Hawai'i's most widespread native tree. Pathogenicity of this fungus was proven and M. polymorpha was recorded as a new host for C. fimbiata. Mortality of 'ohi'a at this scale is of great concern as the understory in these forests is often occupied by invasive non-native plants capable of severely limiting 'ohi'a regeneration. Imagery of 'ohi'a mortality obtained in 2012 revealed large expanses of greater than expected mortality (i.e., >= 10%) across 1600 ha. By 2014 'ohi'a mortality levels >= 10% had spread to 6403 ha, or 30% of total area classified as 'ohi'a in our study area. Further, levels of 'ohi'a mortality in field plots established within the study region averaged 39%, and mortality levels were comparable across size classes and forest compositions. Results from a subset of field plots re-inventoried one year after plot establishment revealed average annual 'ohi'a mortality rates of 24% and 28% based on basal area and stem density measures, respectively; mortality rates were as high as 47% in some field plots. The dearth of 'ohi'a seedling recruitment and characteristic understory dominance of non-native species documented within our research plots, coupled with the lethality of C. fimbriata to 'ohi'a, suggest that these forests likely will be dominated by non-native species in the future.

TI Pinyon-juniper removal has long-term effects on mammals
SO FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB Removing tree cover is a common forest management practice, and pinyon-juniper woodlands in the western United States have been the focus of tree reduction efforts for decades. The scale and intensity of tree removal practices are expected to increase as technology advances and as land managers are tasked with meeting multiple objectives, including fire prevention and habitat enhancement for livestock and wildlife of conservation concern. However, the long-term consequences of pinyon-juniper removal on animal communities are virtually unknown. The objectives of this study were to assess whether mammal habitat use differs between reference pinyon-juniper woodlands and stands that were mechanically disturbed by chaining more than 40 years ago, and to determine if these differences are associated with particular habitat characteristics. We used remotely triggered wildlife cameras to evaluate differences in mammal habitat use of historically chained sites (n = 22) and reference sites (n = 22) in northwestern Colorado. Our results demonstrate marked differences in habitat use between chained sites and reference woodlands for most detected mammal species. Bobcat, mountain lion, American black bear, golden mantled ground squirrel, and rock squirrel all showed a negative response to historically chained sites, indicating long-term effects of tree removal on these species. In contrast, habitat use of chipmunk, mountain cottontail, and coyote did not differ between chained and reference sites. For most species, habitat use was influenced by specific vegetation characteristics, such as proportion of tree cover, which could be factored into management decisions. By understanding the long-term consequences of tree removal for diverse mammal species, we are better equipped to adapt forest management practices to benefit species of both economic and conservation concern.

TI High elevation watersheds in the southern Appalachians: Indicators of
   sensitivity to acidic deposition and the potential for restoration
   through liming
SO FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB Southern Appalachian high elevation watersheds have deep rocky soils with high organic matter content, different vegetation communities, and receive greater inputs of acidic deposition compared to low elevation sites within the region. Since the implementation of the Clean Air Act Amendment in the 1990s, concentrations of acidic anions in rainfall have declined. However, some high elevation streams continue to show signs of chronic to episodic acidity, where acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) ranges from 0 to 20 mu eg L-1. We studied three 3rd order watersheds (North River in Cherokee National Forest, Santeetlah Creek in Nantahala National Forest, and North Fork of the French Broad in Pisgah National Forest) and selected four to six 1st order catchments within each watershed to represent a gradient in elevation (849-1526 m) and a range in acidic stream ANC values (11-50 mu eq L-1). Our objectives were to (1) identify biotic, physical and chemical catchment parameters that could be used as indices of stream ANC, pH and Ca:Al molar ratios and (2) estimate the lime required to restore catchments from the effects of excess acidity and increase base cation availability. We quantified each catchment's biotic, physical, and chemical characteristics and collected stream, O-horizon, and mineral soil samples for chemical analysis seasonally for one year. Using repeated measures analysis, we examined variability in stream chemistry and catchment characteristics; we used a nested split-plot design to identify catchment characteristics that were correlated with stream chemistry. Watersheds differed significantly and the catchments sampled provided a wide range of stream chemical, biotic, physical and chemical characteristics. Variability in stream ANC, pH, and Ca:Al molar ratio were significantly correlated with catchment vegetation characteristics (basal area, tree height, and tree diameter) as well as O-horizon nitrogen and aluminum concentrations. Total soil carbon and calcium (an indicator of parent material), were significant covariates for stream ANC, pH and Ca:AI molar ratios. Lime requirement estimates did not differ among watersheds but this data will help select catchments for future restoration and lime application studies. Not surprisingly, this work found many vegetation and chemical characteristics that were useful indicators of stream acidity. However, some expected relationships such as concentrations of mineral soil extractable Ca and SO4 were not significant. This suggests that an extensive test of these indicators across the southern Appalachians will be required to identify high elevation forested catchments that would benefit from restoration activities.

TI Developing management strategies for tree improvement programs under
   climate change: Insights gained from long-term field trials with
   lodgepole pine
SO FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB The growing concern of the impact of climate change in forestry has prompted tree improvement programs and regulatory agencies to integrate climate change adaptation in the production and use of tree seed. In support of such adaptation strategies, we conducted a case study for lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl.) in Alberta, Canada. We compared the tree height for populations and families planted across 37 progeny and provenance trials when transferred among six physiogeographically and climatically distinct breeding regions. Based on these results we infer how lodgepole populations and families are adapted to current climate conditions and how they might respond to future changes in climate. Interestingly, in almost all regions we found that local populations grew better than introduced sources, suggesting that in the current climate the use of local populations is still an appropriate reforestation strategy with some exceptions. Notably, in cool and wet higher elevation environments (between 1050 and 1650 m), local populations were outgrown by populations originating from warmer lower elevation regions. Moreover, these higher elevation populations were always outgrown when transferred to other regions. A number of transfers among regions were identified that ensure productivity gains under recent climate conditions, and simultaneously represent a short term adaptation measure for warming of about +0.5 degrees C. Further, we provide a database for selection of families within breeding populations to enhance their resilience to climate change. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI The effect of Norway spruce stump harvesting on net nitrogen
   mineralization and nutrient leaching
SO FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB Stumps of conifer trees are a prospective source of bioenergy and stump harvesting is a novel practice in forestry management in the Baltic and Nordic countries. However, as stump harvesting may cause possible environmental risks there has emerged a clear need for research focusing on sustainable forest management.
   Three Norway spruce (Picea abies) clear-cut areas on different soils in Estonia were selected for the present study. We analysed the effect of stump harvesting on net nitrogen mineralization (NNM) and on nutrient leaching. On dry and sandy Endogleyic Arenosol (Oxalis site type), stump harvesting reduced the annul NNM flux significantly; 134 and 202 kg N ha yr(-1) at the harvested and at the control site, respectively. In clear-cut area where Endogleyic Cambisol was dominating (Hepatica site type), stump harvesting had no effect on NNM (92 vs 88 kg N ha yr(-1)). However, in a clear-cut area where the soil type was Endogleyic Albic Podzol (Myrtillys site type), stump harvesting increased the total annual NNM flux: 102 vs 70 kg N ha yr(-1) at the harvested and at the control site, respectively. Stump harvesting affected also the proportion of nitrification and ammonification processes in NNM. At the Myrtillys site type stump harvesting increased the annual nitrogen (N) leaching flux. One year after stump harvesting, leaching at the harvested site was 11.7 vs 4.5 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) at the control site. In the second year N leaching decreased and the difference levelled off. Increased N leaching was induced by a larger amount of water; average N concentration of the harvested and control sites did not differ. Although at the Oxalis site N leaching was larger at the harvested than at the control site, the total annual leached N flux was small (similar to 2 kg N ha(-1)). At the fertile Hepatica site type treatment had no impact on N leaching, which was only ca 1 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Phosphorus (P) leaching was very small in all study areas, being below 0.1 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1).
   The effect of stump harvesting on annual NNM as well as on N leaching was soil specific and highly variable. Stump harvesting affected also the proportion of the nitrification and ammonification processes in total NNM. Considering the first short-term results obtained from different site types, we can conclude that harvesting of spruce stumps does not induce serious environmental hazards in relation of N cycling.

TI Disentangling the effects of forest-stand type and dead-wood origin of
   the early successional stage on the diversity of wood-inhabiting fungi
SO FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB Commercial forestry increasingly aims at both optimizing timber production and maintaining species diversity. To maintain the diversity of the species-rich group of wood-inhabiting fungi, effective forest conservation concepts that include the enrichment of dead wood in commercial forests are required. However, which type of dead wood should be enriched in which type of forest stand (coniferous or broad-leaved) is still debated. Our study aimed at (1) disentangling the relative importance of forest stand type, dead-wood origin (tree species) and time since death and (2) determining whether fungal species richness on logs of broad-leaved trees is higher in broad-leaved stands than in coniferous stands and whether fungal species richness on logs of coniferous trees is higher in coniferous stands than in broad-leaved stands (home-field advantage). We exposed logs of 9 broad-leaved and 4 coniferous tree species in 19 broad-leaved and 9 coniferous forest stands in 2009 and surveyed the logs in 2012 and 2014 for wood-inhabiting fungi. Across all logs, fungal species richness was mainly driven by the tree species of the dead wood and time since death, whereas fungal community composition was solely driven by the tree species of the dead wood. The fungal species richness and community composition of broad-leaved logs was significantly correlated to time since death but not to forest stand type. The fungal species richness and community composition of coniferous logs was neither affected by forest-stand type nor time since death. When individual tree species were considered, forest-stand type did not affect fungal species richness or community compositions, but fungal species richness on logs of Acer, Fagus, Carpinus and Populus increased with time since death. To increase the species richness of wood-inhabiting fungi in commercial forests, we recommend that the tree species diversity of dead wood should be increased and should especially originate from different lineages (angiosperms and gymnosperms), and that a broad variety of successional stages of dead wood should be maintained. Our results suggest that such a strategy would be effective irrespective of the tree species composition of the forest stand, as we found no support for home-field advantages in the early stage of decomposition.

TI Are shallow-soiled sites sensitive to increased biomass removals? An
   operational, paired-wise comparison approach
SO FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB Although commonly cited as being particularly sensitive to biomass/nutrient removals via full-tree harvesting (i.e., entire aboveground portion of the tree is removed and processed at roadside), there have been no long-term experimental trials installed or reported on to date that specifically target shallow soiled (<20 cm) sites common in strongly glaciated boreal landscapes. This study reports on ten year results examining the effects (i.e., regeneration potential, tree growth, soil N availability, and foliar nutrition) of operational full-tree harvesting compared to operational stem only harvesting (i.e., individual stems delimbed and topped at the stump) on replicated, shallow-soiled sites with contrasting soil textures (i.e., sand versus loam) and dominant commercial tree species (i.e., jack pine - Pinus banksiana Lamb. versus black spruce - Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.). The operational harvests at the seven study sites were all conducted during the fall prior to freeze up.
   In terms of tree regeneration metrics, the harvest treatments only had a significant effect on free-to-grow (>1 m) crop tree (jack pine or black spruce) density. Despite the removal of cone-bearing branch material to roadside, the FT harvest treatment blocks had significantly higher densities compared to the SO blocks likely the result of increased mineral soil exposure, improved seedbed receptivity, and warmer soil surface temperatures during the growing season. Initially (5th year), jack pine height growth was better on the FT treatment blocks, but by year 10 this significant effect on total height was gone and the 5-year growth increment was better on the SO treatments. In contrast, black spruce height growth was better on the SO blocks in both year 5 and 10, although the 5-year increment was not significantly different between harvest treatments. Although soil N pools were higher in the SO treatments in year 10, the difference was only reflected in jack pine foliar N, suggesting black spruce may be less sensitive/responsive to declines in soil N pools.
   The 10-year results would suggest that no additional biomass retention restrictions are necessary for full-tree harvesting operations that are targeting traditional wood products (sawlogs and/or pulp & paper) on these shallow-soiled sites. However, some of the noted shifts in some of the measured parameters between year 5 and 10 would suggest longer-term monitoring of these sites will be necessary to provide more conclusive empirical evidence as to the long-term effects of full-tree harvesting on shallow soils within the boreal forest region.

TI Surface Potential Behavior of Direct-Fluorinated PPLP Under Quench
   Condition
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED SUPERCONDUCTIVITY
AB With the emergence of superconductor technology, high-temperature superconducting (HTS) cable is receiving considerable attention for application in power systems. Polypropylene laminated paper (PPLP) and liquid nitrogen (LN2) have been widely used as insulation and coolant, respectively, in HTS cable systems, where the insulation is threatened by surface charge and quench. Direct fluorination is an effective method to improve the electrical properties on the material surface. To restrain the surface charge accumulation and prolong the insulation life, the surface potential behaviors of fluorinated PPLP under the quench condition has been studied to clarify the effects of fluorination time and low temperature. PPLP specimens were fluorinated in a reaction kettle using a F-2/N-2 blend with an 80% volume fraction of nitrogen and pressure of 0.1 MPa for respectively 5, 10, and 15 min. Corona charging was performed with dc voltage at a relative humidity of similar to 15% in atmospheric air on room temperature specimens and after the specimens had been cooled by LN2 for 20 s before the corona charging. Then, the surface potential was measured with an electrostatic voltmeter. The results indicate that the accumulation and decay behaviors of the surface potential for PPLP are affected by the charge polarity, specimen temperature, and fluorination time.

TI Fuzzy temporal fault tree analysis of dynamic systems
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPROXIMATE REASONING
AB Fault tree analysis (FTA) is a powerful technique that is widely used for evaluating system safety and reliability. It can be used to assess the effects of combinations of failures on system behaviour but is unable to capture sequence dependent dynamic behaviour. A number of extensions to fault trees have been proposed to overcome this limitation. Pandora, one such extension, introduces temporal gates and temporal laws to allow dynamic analysis of temporal fault trees (TFTs). It can be easily integrated in model-based design and analysis techniques. The quantitative evaluation of failure probability in Pandora TFTs is performed using exact probabilistic data about component failures. However, exact data can often be difficult to obtain. In this paper, we propose a method that combines expert elicitation and fuzzy set theory with Pandora TFTs to enable dynamic analysis of complex systems with limited or absent exact quantitative data. This gives Pandora the ability to perform quantitative analysis under uncertainty, which increases further its potential utility in the emerging field of model-based design and dependability analysis. The method has been demonstrated by applying it to a fault tolerant fuel distribution system of a ship, and the results are compared with the results obtained by other existing techniques.

TI New Second-Preimage Attacks on Hash Functions
SO JOURNAL OF CRYPTOLOGY
AB In this work, we present several new generic second-preimage attacks on hash functions. Our first attack is based on the herding attack and applies to various Merkle-DamgAyenrd-based iterative hash functions. Compared to the previously known long-message second-preimage attacks, our attack offers more flexibility in choosing the second-preimage message at the cost of a small computational overhead. More concretely, our attack allows the adversary to replace only a few blocks in the original target message to obtain the second preimage. As a result, our new attack is applicable to constructions previously believed to be immune to such second-preimage attacks. Among others, these include the dithered hash proposal of Rivest, Shoup's UOWHF, and the ROX constructions. In addition, we also suggest several time-memory-data tradeoff attack variants, allowing for a faster online phase, and even finding second preimages for shorter messages. We further extend our attack to sequences stronger than the ones suggested in Rivest's proposal. To this end we introduce the kite generator as a new tool to attack any dithering sequence over a small alphabet. Additionally, we analyse the second-preimage security of the basic tree hash construction. Here we also propose several second-preimage attacks and their time-memory-data tradeoff variants. Finally, we show how both our new and the previous second-preimage attacks can be applied even more efficiently when multiple short messages, rather than a single long target message, are available.

TI An Energy-Efficient Reconfigurable ASIP Supporting Multi-mode MIMO
   Detection
SO JOURNAL OF SIGNAL PROCESSING SYSTEMS FOR SIGNAL IMAGE AND VIDEO
   TECHNOLOGY
AB Lattice Reduction aided MIMO detectors have been demonstrated to offer a promising gain by providing near-optimal performance. This paper presents a C-programmable ASIP baseband processor, for near-optimal MIMO detection targeting a 4x4 LTE system. The detector supports multiple MIMO detection modes, with both hard and soft output. In order to improve implementation efficiency, the previously reported MIMO detection algorithm Multi-Tree Selective Spanning Detector (MTSS) is modified to use orthogonal real-valued decomposition (ORVD). Afterwards, a low-complexity log-likelihood-ratio (LLR) improvement technique called counter-ML bit-flipping algorithm is proposed. The proposed LLR generation algorithm has been designed to take advantage of MTSS, by maximizing the reuse of computations. Performance of the proposed solution can be tuned ranging from SIC to near-ML to near-MAP. The baseband processor is designed using 40 nm process technology with an equivalent gate-count (GE) of 68.41 kGE. Operating at 600 MHz for a 4x4 QAM-64 LTE system, the processor delivers peak-throughputs of 3.6 Gbps and 2.05 Gbps in case of hard and soft output MIMO detection, with 13.03 mW and 22.99 mW respective power consumption. The corresponding energy efficiency is 3.61 pJ/bit and 11.17 pJ/bit. In terms of energy efficiency, the proposed reconfigurable solution is comparable to recently reported ASIC MIMO detectors, while providing multiple-modes of operation and the flexilibility of C-programming.

TI Laplacian state transfer in coronas
SO LINEAR ALGEBRA AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB We prove that the corona product of two graphs has no Laplacian perfect state transfer whenever the first graph has at least two vertices. This complements a result of Coutinho and Liu who showed that no tree of size greater than two has Laplacian perfect state transfer. In contrast, we prove that the corona product of two graphs exhibits Laplacian pretty good state transfer, under some mild conditions. This provides the first known examples of families of graphs with Laplacian pretty good state transfer. Our result extends the work of Fan and Godsil on double stars to the Laplacian setting. Moreover, we also show that the corona product of any cocktail party graph with a single vertex graph has Laplacian pretty good state transfer, even though odd cocktail party graphs have no perfect state transfer.

Let p(k) (G) be the number of pendant paths of length k of G, and q(k)(G) be the number of vertices with degree >= 3 which are an end vertex of some pendant paths of length k. Motivated by the problem of characterizing dendritic trees, N. Saito and E. Woei conjectured that any graph G has some Laplacian eigenvalue with multiplicity at least p(k)(G)-q(k)(G).

TI Coxeter energy of graphs
SO LINEAR ALGEBRA AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB We study the concept of the Coxeter energy of graphs and digraphs (quivers) as an analogue of Gutman's adjacency energy, which has applications in theoretical chemistry and is a recently widely investigated graph invariant. Coxeter energy CE(G) of a (di)graph G is defined to be the sum of the absolute values of all complex eigenvalues of the Coxeter matrix associated with G. Our main inspiration for the study comes from the Coxeter formalism appearing in group theory, Lie theory, representation theory of algebras, mathematical physics and other contexts. We focus on the Coxeter energy of trees and we prove that the path (resp. the maximal star) has the smallest (resp. the greatest) Coxeter energy among all trees (resp. two large subclasses of trees) with fixed number of vertices. We provide several other related results, as the characterization of trees with second smallest and second greatest Coxeter energy, bounds for Coxeter energy, and general facts on Coxeter spectra of graphs extending known results e.g. for Salem trees and for certain special real Coxeter eigenvalues of trees. Additionally, we discuss few other energy-like quantities for the Coxeter spectra of (di)graphs, including Coxeter energy "normalized" by the trace of the Coxeter matrix and the quantities derived from variants of Coulson integral formula.

TI WHOLE-BRAIN MAPPING OF AFFERENT PROJECTIONS TO THE BED NUCLEUS OF THE
   STRIA TERMINALIS IN TREE SHREWS
SO NEUROSCIENCE
AB The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) plays an important role in integrating and relaying input information to other brain regions in response to stress. The cytoarchitecture of the BST in tree shrews (Tupaia belangeri chinensis) has been comprehensively described in our previous publications. However, the inputs to the BST have not been described in previous reports. The aim of the present study was to investigate the sources of afferent projections to the BST throughout the brain of tree shrews using the retrograde tracer Fluoro-Gold (FG). The present results provide the first detailed whole-brain mapping of BST-projecting neurons in the tree shrew brain. The BST was densely innervated by the prefrontal cortex, entorhinal cortex, ventral subiculum, amygdala, ventral tegmental area, and parabrachial nucleus. Moreover, moderate projections to the BST originated from the medial preoptic area, supramammillary nucleus, paraventricular thalamic nucleus, pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, dorsal raphe nucleus, locus coeruleus, and nucleus of the solitary tract. Afferent projections to the BST are identified in the ventral pallidum, nucleus of the diagonal band, ventral posteromedial thalamic nucleus, posterior complex of the thalamus, interfascicular nucleus, retrorubral field, rhabdoid nucleus, intermediate reticular nucleus, and parvicellular reticular nucleus. In addition, the different densities of BST-projecting neurons in various regions were analyzed in the tree shrew brains. In summary, whole-brain mapping of direct inputs to the BST is delineated in tree shrews. These brain circuits are implicated in the regulation of numerous physiological and behavioral processes including stress, reward, food intake, and arousal.

TI Assessing the sustainability of local resilience practices against sea
   level rise impacts on the lower Niger delta
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Response strategies determine the resilience of an area to effects of sea level rise. Strategies that are sustainable are those that do not negatively affect the environment, biodiversity and community life of the people. The paper discusses response strategies practiced in the Niger delta to combat effects of sea level rise like: flooding, erosion, inundation, storm surge, and intrusion of sea salt. Local responses to these natural hazards and the degree of effectiveness of the methods in enabling the people return to their normal lives are reviewed for their suitability as future adaptation strategies. GIS and remote sensing analysis of slope and topography show the Niger delta is vulnerable to further flooding, inundation, and erosion as a result of sea level rise. Based on a 'business as usual' scenario, the GIS based bathtub approach is used to calculate and map possible inundation extents for the Niger delta under sea level rise conditions. As the Niger delta is subsiding due to oil and gas exploitation, relative sea level rise (RSLR) values for the Niger delta are obtained by adding measured subsidence values (7 mm and 25 mm) to predicted eustatic sea level rise values (19 mm by 2030 and 35 mm by 2050); resulting in RSLR of 0.14 0.96 m by 2030 and 2050. With subsidence at 7 mm/year and a RSLR of 0.14 m, results for 2030 shows an inundation extent of 11193 km(2) which is 4.6% of the total surface area; subsidence of 25 mm/year (SLR = 0.44 m) gives an inundation extent of 1254.0 km(2) which is 5.2% of the surface area. Results for 2050 show that a rise of 0.29 rn (subsidence = 7 mm/year) will cause an inundation extent of 1175.9 km(2) which is 4.9% of the total surface area, and RSLR of 0.96 m (subsidence = 25 mm/year) inundates 1633.0 km(2) which is 6.8% of the surface area. Although the literature shows local practices have helped people to cope with the challenges posed by flooding, erosion, inundation, and inland intrusion of sea salts, however some of the practices have disadvantages that make them undesirable for inclusion in future planning. Sustainable local practices in the Niger delta include: planting of Bamboo trees for erosion control, use of sandbags as bridges and dikes (flood control), use of flood receptor pits as temporary flood water reservoirs, and community legislation against sand mining and indiscriminate tree felling. Further studies on the limitations of the local resilience practices in the Niger delta is recommended. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Identification of alkyl guaiacyl dehydroabietates as novel markers of
   wood tar from Pinaceae in archaeological samples
SO ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY
AB Resinous material from conifers from the Pinaceae family is frequently found in an archaeological context. The material was used, notably, as waterproofing agent, as adhesive or for the caulking of boats. Two main types of material can be distinguished: resin, the exudate of conifer trees, and wood tar obtained by dry distillation of wood. Molecular investigation of such material aims, notably, at developing new molecular tools for the determination of the biological and geographical origin or of the manufacturing techniques, and for the discrimination between resin and wood tar. In this context, we report the identification by synthesis of alkyl guaiacyl dehydroabietates, which occur in a series of recent and archaeological conifer wood tar samples from shipwrecks and Gallo-Roman tar preparation sites. They most likely result from the reaction of dehydroabietic acid and alkyl guaiacols, the latter being typical wood pyrolysis products formed during the preparation of wood tar. Alkyl guaiacyl dehydroabietates are therefore proposed to be specific molecular markers for conifer wood tar, allowing a clear molecular distinction between this material and resin to be made. They are also more resistant to the alteration undergone by archaeological samples than other compounds previously proposed as markers of conifer wood tar such as anhydrosugars or alkyl guaiacols.

TI Production of leaf wax n-alkanes across a tropical forest elevation
   transect
SO ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY
AB Waxy compounds form the boundary layer of the living leaf and contribute biomarkers to soils, and lake and marine sediments. Cataloging the variation in leaf wax traits between species and across environmental gradients may contribute to the understanding of plant functional processes in modern ecosystems, as well as to calibration efforts supporting reconstruction of past ecosystems and environments from the sedimentary archives of leaf wax biomarkers. Towards these goals, we have surveyed the distributions of leaf wax n-alkanes in trees from the lowland tropical rainforest (TR) and montane cloud forest (TMCF) of Peru. Molecular abundances were quantified via gas chromatography flame ionization detection (GC-FID) for 632 individuals, 152 species, 99 genera and 51 families across 9 forest plots spanning 0.2-3.6 km elevation. We found the expected abundance distributions; for example, they were dominated by long chain, odd numbered n-alkanes, especially C-29 and C-31. New observations included a tendency to increasing total alkane concentration at higher elevation. We propose that the well known leaf economic strategy to increase leaf mass per unit area with elevation, provides a theoretical basis for understanding the increase in leaf wax n-alkane abundance with elevation: we infer an increased investment in foliar defense associated with increased leaf lifespan and in response to environmental pressures including cloud immersion and declining temperature. Furthermore, we combined measurements of n-alkane concentration with estimates of forest productivity to provide new ways to quantify ecosystem-scale forest alkane productivity. We introduce a new concept of n-alkane net primary productivity (NPPalk; the product of alkane concentration and leaf NPP) and find that alkane productivity estimates range from 300 to 5000 g C/ha/yr, associated with ecological and environmental changes across the elevation profile.

TI Dissolved organic carbon and its potential predictors in eutrophic lakes
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB Understanding of the true role of lakes in the global carbon cycle requires reliable estimates of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and there is a strong need to develop remote sensing methods for mapping lake carbon content at larger regional and global scales. Part of DOC is optically inactive. Therefore, lake DOC content cannot be mapped directly. The objectives of the current study were to estimate the relationships of DOC and other water and environmental variables in order to find the best proxy for remote sensing mapping of lake DOC. The Boosted Regression Trees approach was used to clarify in which relative proportions different water and environmental variables determine DOC. In a studied large and shallow eutrophic lake the concentrations of DOC and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) were rather high while the seasonal and interannual variability of DOC concentrations was small. The relationships between DOC and other water and environmental variables varied seasonally and inter annually and it was challenging to find proxies for describing seasonal cycle of DOC. Chlorophyll a (Chl a), total suspended matter and Secchi depth were correlated with DOC and therefore are possible proxies for remote sensing of seasonal changes of DOC in ice free period, while for long term interannual changes transparency-related variables are relevant as DOC proxies. CDOM did not appear to be a good predictor of the seasonality of DOC concentration in Lake Vortsjarv since the CDOM DOC coupling varied seasonally. However, combining the data from Vortsjarv with the published data from six other eutrophic lakes in the world showed that CDOM was the most powerful predictor of DOC and can be used in remote sensing of DOC concentrations in eutrophic lakes.

TI Life cycle water footprint of hydrogenation-derived renewable diesel
   production from lignocellulosic biomass
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB The conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to biofuel requires water. This study is focused on the production of hydrogenation-derived renewable diesel (HDRD) from lignocellulosic biomass. Although there has been considerable focus on the assessment of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, there is limited work on the assessment of the life cycle water footprint of HDRD production. This paper presents a life cycle water consumption study on lignocellulosic biomass to HDRD via pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) processes. The results of this study show that whole tree (i.e., tree chips) biomass has water requirements of 497.79 L/MJ HDRD and 376.16 L/MJ HDRD for production through fast pyrolysis and the HTL process, respectively. Forest residues (i.e., chips from branches and tops generated during logging operations) have water requirements of 338.58 L/MJ HDRD and 255.85 L/MJ HDRD for production through fast pyrolysis and the HTL process, respectively. Agricultural residues (i.e., straw from wheat, oats, and barley), which are more water efficient, have water requirements of 83.7 L/MJ HDRD and 59.1 L/MJ HDRD through fast pyrolysis and the HTL process, respectively. Differences in water use between feedstocks and conversion processes indicate that the choices of biomass feedstock and conversion pathway water efficiency are crucial factors affecting water use efficiency of HDRD production.

TI Profiling small scale domestic grower cannabis users.
SO ANALES DE PSICOLOGIA
AB Cannabis is the most widely used worldwide drug with prevalence between 2.8 and 5.0% of the adult population. Increasing use of cannabis has carried out to an escalation in home growing for self consumption. As a consequence, a field study to contrast if the domestic cannabis growers exhibited a different sociodemographic profile, a consumption pattern, a problematic use risk, dependence level, as well as on the clinical symptoms and related disorders, was designed. As for this, 761 cannabis users, 480 males and 281 females, of whom 251 were homegrowers for personal use (182 males and 69 females), with ages ranging from 18 to 60 years (M = 26.36, SD = 5.68), answered to a sociodemohgraphic and consumption pattern questionnaire, and to cannabis problematic use, cannabis dependence, cannabis abuse, and nicotine and alcohol dependence scales. The results showed that homegrowers are mostly males, with low academic training and working. Moreover, homegrowers have a higher cannabis consumption rates, are more implied in cannabis selling, polysubstance use, and with more psychosocial problem driven from cannabis use. Finally, homegrowers inform of higher problematic cannabis use and a higher level of cannabis dependence. The implications of the results for prevention police, and treatment of the cannabis use disorder are discussed.

TI Does climate constrain the spread of Anthonomus santacruzi, a biological
   control agent of Solanum mauritianum, in South Africa?
SO BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
AB The flowerbud-feeding weevil, Anthonomus santacruzi Hustache (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), was released in 2008 as a biological control agent against the South American invasive tree Solanum mauritianum Scop. (Solanaceae), in South Africa. The weevil has since established in two localities, namely along the KwaZulu-Natal South Coast and around the Sabie region of Mpumalanga. Recent releases on the Highveld region (Johannesburg and Pretoria) have been unsuccessful to date. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that climate, particularly low temperature and low relative humidity, restricts the survival and establishment of A. santacruzi in South Africa. The survival of A. santacruzi adults in relation to low temperatures and relative humidities was assessed in the laboratory. Climate analyses revealed that matches of <50% were associated with failure to establish and that minimum temperature and relative humidity displayed the greatest discrepancies between South American collection and South African release sites. Thermal assessments on A. santacruzi adults calculated the CTmin and LT50 as 4.1 +/- 0.2 degrees C (n = 20) and -4.2 +/- 0.3 degrees C (n = 90) respectively. The LH50 of A. santacruzi adults was calculated as 46.9%. The establishment of A. santacruzi at only the warm and humid release sites in South Africa advocates for the consideration of low temperature and low humidity as factors impeding the agents' establishment, particularly on the cooler and drier Highveld.

TI Native rhizobacteria as biocontrol agents of Heterobasidion annosum s.s.
   and Armillaria mellea infection of Pinus radiata
SO BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
AB Biocontrol bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens, Bacillus simplex and two different strains of Erwinia billingiae were isolated from the rhizosphere of a healthy tree located in a Pinus radiata plantation with high presence of fungal pathogens. The bacteria were selected based on a high level of antagonism in vitro against P. radiata pathogens Heterobasidion annosum s.s. (68.6-99.3% area inhibition percent (AIP)) and Armillaria mellea (64.8%-94.2% AIP). None of the bacteria were pathogenic for two-month-old seedlings of P. radiata. P. fluorescens and B. simplex reduced the incidence of H. annosum and A. mellea infection on P. radiata. While H. annosum was detected in 90% of seedlings that were not inoculated with bacteria, detection was reduced to 40% and 55% of seedlings treated with P. fluorescens and B. simplex, respectively. Following infection with A. mellea, 54% of the seedlings that were not treated with bacteria died, whereas for those treated with P. fluorescens, B. simplex and the two strains of E. billingiae, the proportion of plants that died was 13.1%, 7.1%, 3.6% and 11.6% respectively.

TI Establishment of classical biological control targeting emerald ash
   borer is facilitated by use of insecticides, with little effect on
   native arthropod communities
SO BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
AB Emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), is rapidly invading North America and has inflicted extensive ash, Fraxinus spp., mortality in affected areas, altering composition and structure of wildland and urban forests. Insecticides can effectively protect ash on a small scale and classical biological control efforts have been implemented. In the U.S. emerald ash borer kills native ash so quickly, and populations are so mobile, that establishing an effective biological control program is challenging. Consequently, we assessed the compatibility of using reduced rates of the insecticide imidacloprid applied as a soil drench coupled with releases of three species of parasitic wasps. In this way we hope to slow the process of ash decline and prolong the window of opportunity to allow biological control agents to become established. We compared the efficacy and effects of i) full strength imidacloprid applications, ii) reduced rates of imidacloprid coupled with classical biological control, iii) classical biological control alone, and iv) untreated controls. We monitored emerald ash borer adult activity through trapping and destructive sampling for larvae, evaluated larval parasitization rates, and also assessed the native hymenopteran communities. Chemical treatments were not adequate to prevent ash canopy decline, but they also did not impede parasitization of emerald ash borer eggs or larvae. Two of the three classical biological control agents, Oobius agrili and Tetrastichus planipennisi, were recovered from trees treated with imidacloprid, demonstrating that they were successfully reproducing and indicating the compatibility of the two management strategies. Non-target hymenopterans appeared unaffected by the insecticide applications. Importantly we found no negative effects of the imidacloprid applications on native pollinators. Collectively these data suggest that judicious use of insecticides coupled with classical biological control may be an effective and potentially sustainable approach to managing invading populations of emerald ash borer.

TI Tamarix dieback and vegetation patterns following release of the
   northern tamarisk beetle (Diorhabda carinulata) in western Colorado
SO BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
AB The northern tamarisk beetle (Diorhabda carinulata) was released in 2001 as a biocontrol agent for Tamarix spp., an invasive tree that dominates riparian ecosystems throughout the southwestern United States. The factors that influence its effectiveness at controlling Tamarix, and the effects of control on plant communities, are not well known. Here we report patterns of Tamarix dieback, mortality, and vegetation composition at ten of the early D. carinulata release sites in western Colorado. Across the ten release sites, 265 permanently marked Tamarix trees were measured over a six year period (2008-2014). Vegetation composition and woody debris adjacent to each of these trees were measured annually for four years (2011-2014). We examined relationships between site factors (soil properties, hydrology, and land use history), Tamarix dieback, and vegetation composition. Tamarix mortality was observed at seven of ten sites, where it ranged from 15% to 56% after six years. Overall, Tamarix crown cover decreased by more than half (54%) while crown volume decreased by 63% in the first two years of the study. Neither total plant cover nor fallen woody debris increased under Tamarix trees over the last four years of the study. Combined cover of classified noxious weeds and other non-native species was greater than native plant cover at eight of ten sites. D. carinulata proved to be effective in controlling the Tamarix invasion locally. However, the high cover of noxious weeds will continue to be a management problem, with or without Tamarix control by the northern tamarisk beetle. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Differentiation of some indigenous and exotic trichogrammatids
   (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) from India based on Internal
   transcribed spacer-2 and cytochrome oxidase-I markers and their
   phylogenetic relationship
SO BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
AB Trichogrammatids (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) are the most important egg parasitoids widely used in different biocontrol programs worldwide. Since there are several species, strains, and ecotypes available, correct identification is the first step for successful biological control programs. Morphological identification remains complex due to subtle difference in male genetalia, therefore alternative molecular techniques were employed for rapid and reliable identification of this group of parasitoids. Furthermore, many of the field collected specimens are females, which are not identifiable using morphological keys. This study was carried out to unravel the discrimination success in the two molecular marker loci cytochrome oxidase I (COI) and internal transcribed spacer-2 (ITS-2) region of trichogrammatids. In achieving these objectives, the single specimen of 22 trichogrammatids belonging to 19 species were subjected to DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and sequencing. Additionally, we obtained homologous sequences from GenBank and sequences in BOLD database to understand internal relationships between the trichogrammatids. Bayesian inference phylogenetic analysis conducted with 84 and 76 sequences of COI and ITS-2 loci respectively and studied discrimination among the different species. Based on trees in comparison, we observed that there was a total of 10 and 6 out of 19 species correctly discriminate with COI and ITS-2 respectively. Our result revealed that the ITS-2 gene was less divergent than the COI gene in the majority of species and failed to differentiate all terminal clades. Therefore, we recommend that COI is suitable as the primary DNA barcode locus in trichogrammatids. Overall, we suggest that COI gene has higher discrimination power and can be considered as an appropriate molecular marker for species identification in trichogrammatids. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

TI Monitoring the establishment and abundance of introduced parasitoids of
   emerald ash borer larvae in Maryland, USA
SO BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
AB Classical biological control can be an important tool for managing invasive species such as emerald ash borer (EAB), Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire. Emerald ash borer was first detected in Maryland in 2003, and the biological control program to manage this beetle in Maryland was initiated in 2009. Here we examine the establishment and abundance of two introduced parasitoids of EAB larvae (Spathius agrili Yang and Tetrastichus planipennisi Yang). Overall, 56,677 S. agrili and 191,506 T. planipennisi were released at 26 and 32 sites, respectively, from 2009 to 2014. Monitoring parasitoids involved debarking trees, and harvesting trees to place in rearing barrels, and was conducted at 47 sites (23 of which received parasitoids, and 24 of which served as controls) from 2010 to 2015. We recovered 77 S. agrili from 16 EAB larvae at six sites, and 1856 T. planipennisi from 110 EAB larvae at 19 sites. Percentage parasitism by T. planipennisi, and the mean percentage of trees containing T. planipennisi broods, were positively associated with the number of years post-release of the parasitoids (reaching 11.6% and 41.7% four years post-release, respectively). The relationship between T. planipennisi parasitism and tree size was best described by an exponential decrease model, with over 95% of parasitism occurring in trees with a diameter at breast height of <16 cm. In conclusion, T. planipennisi has established populations and dispersed in Maryland, while S. agrili releases have been largely unsuccessful. These findings are a step towards optimizing EAB biological control release and recovery strategies, and are particularly pertinent for other states in the Mid-Atlantic region. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

TI Predation by flat bark beetles (Coleoptera: Silvanidae and
   Laemophloeidae) on coffee berry borer (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) in
   Hawaii coffee
SO BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
AB Coffee berry borer (CBB), Hypothenemus hampei (Ferrari) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is a serious pest of coffee worldwide and a new invasive pest in Hawaii. Adult flat bark beetles, mainly Leptophloeus sp. (75%) and Cathartus quadricollis (21%) (Coleoptera: Laemophloeidae and Silvanidae, respectively), were found inside CBB-infested coffee beans on the tree and molecular marker studies confirmed feeding on CBB. Research was conducted to better understand the ecology of these predators and explore ways to increase their role in suppressing CBB populations in coffee. Laboratory feeding assays demonstrated the capacity for adult and larval flat bark beetles to feed on all CBB life stages. The predators are widely distributed in the coffee growing areas on the island of Hawaii, but feed mainly in dried coffee on the tree rather than in ripening berries where initial crop damage occurs. Berlese funnel extraction of flat bark beetles from dried beans on the tree indicated that predator numbers can be relatively high (up to 23 adult predators per 150 bean sample). C. quadricollis was not susceptible to infection by the fungal biopesticide Beauveria bassiana which is used for field control of CBB in coffee. Leptophloeus sp. and C. quadricollis can be raised easily on a diet of cracked corn and cornmeal. Augmentative releases of generalist flat bark beetle predators like Leptophloeus sp. and C. quadricollis may be a useful component of integrated pest management programs against coffee berry borer and other scolytine pests.

PLGA-based multiparticulate dosage forms are usually prepared as microspheres where the size is from 5 to 100 mu m, depending on the route of administration. The main objectives of the study were to develop a predictive model of mean volumetric particle size and on its basis extract knowledge of PLGA containing proteins forming behaviour.
   Methods: In the present study, a model for the prediction of mean volumetric particle size developed by an rgp package of R environment is presented. Other tools like fscaret, monmlp, fugeR, MARS, SVM, kNNreg, Cubist, randomForest and piecewise linear regression are also applied during the data mining procedure.
   Results: The feature selection provided by the fscaret package reduced the original input vector from a total of 295 input variables to 10, 16 and 19. The developed models had good predictive ability, which was confirmed by a normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE) of 6.8 to 11.1% in 10-fold cross validation training procedure. Moreover, the best models were validated using external experimental data. The superior predictiveness had a model obtained by rgp in the form of a classical equation with a normalized root-mean-squared error (NRMSE) of 6.1%.
   Conclusions: A new approach is proposed for computational modelling of the mean particle size of PLGA microspheres and rules extraction from tree-based models. The feature selection leads to revealing chemical descriptor variables which are important in predicting the size of PLGA microspheres. In order to achieve better understanding in the relationships between particle size and formulation characteristics, the surface analysis method and rules extraction procedures were applied.

TI New petrified forest in Maranhao, Permian (Cisuralian) of the Parnaiba
   Basin, Brazil
SO JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
AB This work presents a new fossil plant-bearing area located in the municipalities of Duque Bacelar and Coelho Neto, Maranhao State, Brazil, recovered from lower Permian (Cisuralian) strata of the Pedra de Fogo Formation, northeastern portion of the Parnaiba Basin. The area comprises more than five exposures with assemblages formed mostly of large gymnosperm woods, a number of them in life-position (reaching up to similar to 230 m in height and 1.15 m in diameter) and, in lesser degree, of horizontal tree-fern stems (up to 5 m in length), some of them being referable to Psaronius sp. The fossils are recorded in sedimentary beds of continental origin that accumulated in shallow, nearshore areas of large lakes, which eventually were affected by rapid burial episodes generated by non-channelized, high energy fluvial systems. The new fossil assemblages are included within lacustrine rocks placed at the base of the Pedra de Fogo Formation, i.e., Silex Basal Member, near the contact with the underlying Piaui Formation (Pennsylvanian). This observation contrasts with previous studies at the southwestern portion of the basin, where the stratigraphic position of plant fossils is referred to the upper Pedra de Fogo Formation (Trisidela Member) or even to the overlying Motuca Formation. The new sites currently suffer damage from human activities and require urgent actions in order to protect them. Based on the current laws, some measures of protection for these sites are discussed and proposed herein. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Degradation of ground-based RADAR performance due to vegetation cover
SO MEASUREMENT
AB Several studies indicate that vegetation attenuates and scatters radio waves. Although researchers considered vegetation as a soft obstacle in terms of total attenuation, actual measurements show that trees or shrubs could induce important attenuations. This opens a possible use when looking for radar invisibility shields to protect selected targets. Is it possible to use vegetation as an invisibility cover? If so, under which conditions this procedure would work? These are the questions this paper tries to answer, analysing the degradation in the probability of detection that a vegetation cover induces in the radar system. We present the results from large measurement campaigns on attenuation due to vegetation, performed at radar UHF and microwave frequencies; then we use them to evaluate the reduction in the radar performance when trying to detect a target protected by a vegetation cover. We demonstrate that vegetation covers lead to reductions in probability of detection to values below 0.1 considering single pulse radars, which means that the target would be undetectable. We conclude that the proposal would be reliable, even taking into account other additional effects, as pulse integration, the natural time variability of the induced attenuation, and the noise increase due to the vegetation scattering.

TI Microstructural changes while persimmon fruits mature and ripen.
   Comparison between astringent and non-astringent cultivars
SO POSTHARVEST BIOLOGY AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Persimmon cultivars are classified into two categories, those that bear astringent fruit at harvest and those that bear non-astringent fruit. Causes of natural astringency loss that fruits of non-astringent cultivars undergo on tree are yet to be clarified. A physicochemical and microstructural study of the maturity process of two astringent cultivars ('Rojo Brillante' and 'Giombo'), and two non-astringent ones ('Fuyu' and 'Hana Fuyu') has been carried out. Light microscopy (LM) analysis allowed visualizing the higher soluble tannins content in astringent cultivars compared to non-astringent ones in early maturity stages as well as the natural tannin insolubilization that took place in both the astringent and non-astringent cultivars during maturation and ripening. In astringent cultivars this tannin insolubilization process was gradual and led to a progressive decline in soluble tannins. In non-astringent cultivars this insolubilization was much faster than in astringent cultivars. The present study also revealed that both colour evolution and fruit softening during maturation are characteristic for each cultivar, although in all of them a strong negative correlation was observed between these two parameters. Fruit softening was associated with a gradual parenchyma structure loss due to a cell wall and membrane degradation process. The total soluble solids content was found to be a good indicator of the sugars level in non-astringent cultivars, but should be ruled out in astringent varieties. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI Estimating biophysical parameters of Persian oak coppice trees using
   UltraCam-D airborne imagery in Zagros semi-arid woodlands
SO JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
AB This study provides insight into the quantitative assessment of biophysical parameters of Persian oak coppice trees Using UltraCam-D (UC-D) very high spatial resolution airborne orthoimagery in Zagros semi-arid woodlands, West Iran. We estimated the parameters across two methods: 1) direct quantification of tree density using line intercept sampling (LIS) method, tree height (TH) by shadow length, crown diameter (CD) by manual measurement, and crown area (CA) using support vector machine classifier, and 2) indirect quantification of diameter at root collar (DRC) and basal area (BA) by the allometric equations employing CD. The validation method consisted of taking field measurements of the parameters of a total of 162 coppice trees in a 30 ha study plot. The results of the validation assessment revealed the effective estimation of TH (R-2 = 0.85 and RMSE of 1.00 m), CD (R-2 = 0.92 and RMSE of 1.19 m), CA (R-2 = 0.85 and RMSE of 1639 m(2)), DRC (R-2 = 0.87 and RMSE of 0.05 m), and BA (R-2 = 0.82 and RMSE of 0.04 m(2)), when compared against the validation data. Hence, we show that UC-D data are a practical alternative to filed measurements for characterization of coppice tree biophysical parameters in semi-arid woodlands which can be applied for woodland planning and management.

TI Vegetation composition and structure changes following roller-chopping
   deforestation in central Argentina woodlands
SO JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
AB Driven by the pressure of increasing forage production, dry forests and woodlands of Argentina are suffering one of the highest deforestation rates in the world. In this study we combined field work and a remote sensing approach to assess the successional trajectory in terms of functional group diversity and ecosystem phenology, following roller chopping deforestation in a woodland of central Argentina. The first year after disturbance, shrub cover decreased at the same proportion than grass cover increased while tree cover was drastically reduced. After 3 years, shrubs recovered 70% of the original cover and grasses maintained a relatively high proportion, but tree cover remained low. Roller-chopping favoured early over late successional species in the case of woody plants, but had the inverse effect in the case of grasses. At ecosystem scale the length of the growing season was drastically shortened by 100 days following disturbance. Roller chopping improves ecosystem services of provision by enhancing forage's offer but at the same time deteriorated the system by reducing functional plant diversity and by shortening the growing season, with potential cascade-consequences on other ecosystem processes such as the carbon and water dynamics.

TI Impact of a severe frost event in 2014 on woody vegetation within the
   Nama-Karoo and semi-arid savanna biomes of South Africa
SO JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
AB The plains of the Nama-Karoo biome in southern Africa are characterised by a mixture of dwarf shrubs and grasses with near absence of shrubs and trees that are conspicuous in the adjacent savanna biome and on hills. We investigated the impact of a severe frost event in 2014 on the abundance and composition of woody vegetation in relation to local topography at three widely separated locations. Long-term weather records of 44, 53, and 83 years confirmed that the 2014 event was the 16th, 6th, and 12th percentile of cold years across three locations. An event of similar severity had not occurred for >7 years at the Nama-Karoo locations but had at the savanna location. Woody vegetation lost 60-100% of canopy volume at the base of a slope but no loss had occurred at elevations of 30-100 m above this. Regrowth volume after one season was linearly related to volume lost to frost although most plants had not recovered pre-frost volume. All dominant woody species experienced substantial topkill. Microphyllous species appeared particularly sensitive to frost. Results suggest frost contributes to maintaining the treeless character of the Nama-Karoo biome and to containing bush encroachment along drainage lines within the savanna biome.

TI Vegetative propagation of Boswellia papyrifera: Time of collection and
   propagule size affect survival and establishment
SO JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
AB In the dry woodlands of Africa, stem cuttings of some tree species can root easily for successful vegetative propagation. Successful rooting and establishment of planted cuttings can be affected by size of cutting, planting season, age of parent stock and part of plant used. Propagule length and four collection times were studied on their effect on the survival of branch cuttings of Boswellia papyrifera over a six-year period. The study was carried in a semi-arid area of northwest Ethiopia, where the rainfall occurs from June to September and the other part of the year being too dry to normal plant physiological functioning. Collection time, cutting length and their interaction showed significant differences in mean survival rate. The higher mean survival value was observed from those cutting materials collected in May. The weakest performance was observed from those cutting materials collected in October. The observed difference may be effect of phenological calendar of the species, especially the effect of dormancy period and leaf bud breaking times. Longer stem cuttings did not show persistent better performance across time. This technique could be an alternative solution for restocking the declining B. papyrifera population and fast restoration of degraded dry lands. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Inflammatory biomarkers and spontaneous preterm birth among obese women
SO JOURNAL OF MATERNAL-FETAL & NEONATAL MEDICINE
AB Objective: To identify associations between second-trimester serum inflammatory biomarkers and preterm birth among obese women.Methods: In this nested case-control study, we compared 65 serum inflammatory biomarkers in obese women whose pregnancies resulted in early spontaneous preterm birth (<32 weeks gestation, n=34) to obese women whose pregnancies resulted in term birth (n=34). These women were selected from a larger population-based California cohort. Random forest and classification and regression tree techniques were employed to identify biomarkers of importance, and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using logistic regression.Results: Random forest and classification and regression tree techniques found that soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (sVEGFR3), soluble interleukin-2 receptor alpha-chain (sIL-2RA) and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (sTNFR1) were related to preterm birth. Using multivariable logistic regression to compare preterm cases and term controls, decreased serum levels of sVEGFR3 and increased serum levels of sIL-2RA and sTNFR1 were associated with increased risk of preterm birth among obese women, aOR=3.2 (95% CI: 1.0-9.9), aOR=2.8 (95% CI: 0.9-9.0), and aOR=4.1 (95% CI: 1.2-14.1), respectively.Conclusions: In this pilot study, we identified three serum biomarkers indicative of inflammation to be associated with spontaneous preterm birth among obese women: sVEGFR3, sIL-2RA and sTNFR1.

TI Corticosterone levels in relation to trace element contamination along
   an urbanization gradient in the common blackbird (Turdus merula)
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB In a rapidly urbanizing world, trace element pollution may represent a threat to human health and wildlife, and it is therefore crucial to assess both exposition levels and associated effects of trace element contamination on urban vertebrates. In this study, we investigated the impact of urbanization on trace element contamination and stress physiology in a wild bird species, the common blackbird (Turdus merula), along an urbanization gradient (from rural to moderately urbanized areas). Specifically, we described the contamination levels of blackbirds by 4 non-essential (Ag, Cd, Hg, Pb) and 9 essential trace elements (As, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Se, Zn), and explored the putative disrupting effects of the non-essential element contamination on corticosterone levels (a hormonal proxy for environmental challenges). We found that non-essential trace element burden (Cd and Pb specifically) increased with increasing urbanization, indicating a significant trace element contamination even in medium sized cities and suburban areas. Interestingly, the increased feather non-essential trace element concentrations were also associated with elevated feather corticosterone levels, suggesting that urbanization probably constrains birds and that this effect may be mediated by trace element contamination. Future experimental studies are now required to disentangle the influence of multiple urban-related constraints on corticosterone levels and to specifically test the influence of each of these trace elements on corticosterone secretion.

TI The influence of vegetation on soil water repellency-markers and soil
   hydrophobicity
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Soil water repellency (SWR) markers are defined as hydrophobic compounds in soil causing SWR and are mainly derived from plants. Previous studies have shown the types and abundance of SWR-markers in soils. However, how these SWR-markers are exactly related to SWR and their origin is poorly understood. This study aims to understand the relationship between SWR-markers, vegetation type and cover and SWR for a simple sandy soil ecosystem, consisting of oaks with sedge and six grass species. All the soil ( at different depth) and vegetation samples were collected in the field along a 6 m transect, starting from an oak tree. Further along the transect grasses and sedges became more abundant. Free and ester-bound lipids from soils and plant leaves/roots were obtained using a sequential extraction method and identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Significant linear correlations were found between the main soil characteristics, such as total organic carbon content, and SWR. Single long-chain (>C-20) SWR-markers derived from both plant leaf waxes and roots positively related to SWR. Both ester-bound omega-hydroxy fatty acids and C-22 and C-24 alpha,omega-dicarboxylic acids were predominantly present in the grass roots, but to a lesser extent in the roots of oak and sedge. These suberin-derived omega-hydroxy fatty acids and alpha,omega-dicarboxylic acids characteristic of roots could well predict the SWR. Additionally, the SWR predictors abundantly present in the soils matched well with high concentrations of the corresponding bio-markers in the dominant vegetation species that covered the soils. Our analyses demonstrated that grass roots influenced SWR more due to their more substantial contribution of organic matter to the topsoils than oak roots. This led to a stronger SWR of the soils covered with grass than those covered with oak vegetation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Sewage sludge stabilisation and fertiliser value in a silvopastoral
   system developed with Eucalyptus nitens Maiden in Lugo (Spain)
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Copper (Cu) is one of the heavy metals with highest proportion in sewage sludge. In Europe, sewage sludge should be stabilised before using it as a fertiliser in agriculture. Depending on the stabilisation process, sewage sludge has different Cu contents, and soil Cu incorporation rates. This study was undertaken to examine the effect of fertilisation with different types of sewage sludge (anaerobic, composted, and pelletised) on the concentration of total and available Cu in the soil, the tree growth, the pasture production, and the concentration of Cu in the pasture when compared with control treatments (i.e. no fertilisation and mineral fertilisation) in a silvopastoral system under Eucalyptus nitens Maiden. The results of this experiment show that an improvement of the soil pH increased the incorporation and the mineralisation of the sewage sludge and litter, and therefore, the release of Cu from the soil. Moreover, the concentration of Cu in the pasture and the levels of Cu extracted by the pasture improved when the soil organic matter decreased because the high levels of organic matter in the soil could have formed Cu complex. The composted sewage sludge (COM) increased a) the soil variables studied (pH, total Cu, and available Cu) and b) the Cu extracted by the pasture, both probably due to the higher inputs of cations made with it. In any case, the levels of Cu found in the soil never exceeded the maximums as set by Spanish regulations and did not cause harmful effects on the plants and animals. Therefore, the use of COM as an organic fertiliser should be promoted in silvopastoral systems established in edaphoclimatic conditions similar to this study because COM enhanced the productivity of the system from a viewpoint of the soil and the pasture, without causing any environmental damage.

TI Common trends in elements? Within- and between-tree variations of
   wood-chemistry measured by X-ray fluorescence - A dendrochemical study
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Element composition of annually resolved tree-rings constitutes a promising biological proxy for reconstructions of environmental conditions and pollution history. However, several methodological and physiological issues have to be addressed before sound conclusions can be drawn from dendrochemical time series. For example, radial and vertical translocation processes of elements in the wood might blur or obscure any dendrochemical signal. In this study, we tested the degree of synchronism of elemental time series within and between trees of one coniferous (Pinus sylvestris L.) and one broadleaf (Castanea sativa Mill.) species growing in conventionally managed forests without direct pollution sources in their surroundings. Micro X-ray fluorescence (mu XRF) analysis was used to establish time series of relative concentrations of multiple elements (Mg, Al, P, Cl, K, Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe and Ni) for different stem heights and stem exposures. We found a common long-term(decadal) trend for most elements in both species, but only little coherence in the high frequency domain (inter-annual variations). Aligning the element curves by cambial age instead of year of ring formation reduced the standard deviations between the single measurements. This points at an influence of age on longer term trends and would require a detrending in order to extract any environmental signal from dendrochemical time series. The common signal was stronger for pine than for chestnut. In pine, many elements show a concentration gradient with higher values towards the tree crown. Mobility of elements in the stemleading to high within- and between-tree variability, as well as a potential age-trend apparently complicate the establishment of reliable dendrochemical chronologies. For future wood-chemical studies, we recommend to work with element ratios instead of single element time series, to consider potential age trends and to analyze more than one sample per tree to account for internal variability.

A guard must move from a neighboring vertex to an attacked vertex (we assume attacks happen only at vertices containing no guard and that each vertex contains at most one guard). More than one guard is allowed to move in response to an attack. The m-eternal domination number, gamma(infinity)(m)(G), of a graph G is the minimum number of guards needed to defend G against any such sequence.

TI Some edge-grafting transformations on the eccentricity
   resistance-distance sum and their applications
SO DISCRETE APPLIED MATHEMATICS
AB The eccentricity resistance-distance sum of a connected graph G is defined as xi(R)(G) = Sigma({u,v}subset of VG)(epsilon(G)(u) + epsilon(G)(v))R-uv(G), where epsilon(G)(.) is the eccentricity of the corresponding vertex and R-uv(G) is the resistance distance between u and v in graph G. In this paper some edge-grafting transformations on the eccentricity resistance-distance sum of a connected graph are studied, which is mainly focused on the monotonicity on each of these edge-grafting transformations for xi(R). As applications, on the one hand, we determined the graph with the minimum xi(R)-value among the set of all n-vertex cacti each of which contains just t cycles, and on the other hand, sharp lower bound on xi(R) of graphs among the n-vertex cacti is determined. The corresponding extremal graphs are identified. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Liar's dominating sets in graphs
SO DISCRETE APPLIED MATHEMATICS
AB A set L subset of V of a graph G = (V, E) is a liar's dominating set if (1) for every vertex u is an element of V, vertical bar N[u] boolean AND L vertical bar >= 2 and (2) for every pair u, v is an element of V of distinct vertices, vertical bar(N[u] boolean OR N[v]) boolean AND L vertical bar >= 3. In this paper, we first provide a characterization of graphs G with gamma(LR)(G) = vertical bar V vertical bar as well as the trees T with gamma(LR)(T) = vertical bar V vertical bar - 1. Then we present some bounds on the liar's domination number, especially an upper bound for the ratio between the liar's domination number and the double domination number is established for connected graphs with girth at least five. Finally, we determine the exact value of the liar's domination number for the complete r-partite graphs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Degree condition for completely independent spanning trees
SO INFORMATION PROCESSING LETTERS
AB Let T-1, T-2,...,T-k be spanning trees of a graph G. For any two vertices u, v of G, if the paths from u to v in these k trees are pairwise openly disjoint, then we say that T-1, T-2,...,T-k are completely independent. Araki showed that a graph G on n >= 7 vertices has two completely independent spanning trees if the minimum degree delta(G) >= n/2. In this paper, we give a generalization: a graph G on n >= 4k - 1 vertices has k completely independent spanning trees if the minimum degree delta(G) >= k-1/kn. In fact, we prove a stronger result.

TI Social structure optimization in team formation
SO COMPUTERS & OPERATIONS RESEARCH
AB This paper presents a mathematical framework for treating the Team Formation Problem explicitly incorporating Social Structure (TFP-SS), the formulation of which relies on modern social network analysis theories and metrics. While recent research qualitatively establishes the dependence of team performance on team social structure, the presented framework introduces models that quantitatively exploit such dependence. Given a pool of individuals, the TFP-SS objective is to assign them to teams so as to achieve an optimal structure of individual attributes and social relations within the teams. The paper explores TFP-SS instances with measures based on such network structures as edges, full dyads, triplets, k-stars, etc., in undirected and directed networks. For an NP-Hard instance of TFP-SS, an integer program is presented, followed by a powerful Lin-Kernighan-TFP (LK-TFP) heuristic that performs variable-depth neighborhood search. The idea of such lambda-opt sequential search was first employed by Lin and Kernighan, and refined by Helsgaun, for successfully treating large Traveling Salesman Problem instances but has seen limited use in other applications. This paper describes LK-TFP as a tree search procedure and discusses the reasons of its effectiveness. Computational results for small, medium and large TFP-SS instances are reported using LK-TFP and compared with those of an exact algorithm (CPLEX) and a Standard Genetic Algorithm (SGA). Finally, the insights generated by the presented framework and directions for future research are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI On covering location problems on networks with edge demand
SO COMPUTERS & OPERATIONS RESEARCH
AB This paper considers two covering location problems on a network where the demand is distributed along the edges. The first is the classical maximal covering location problem. The second problem is the obnoxious version where the coverage should be minimized subject to some distance constraints between the facilities. It is first shown that the finite dominating set for covering problems with nodal demand does not carry over to the case of edge based demands. Then, a solution approach for the single facility problem is presented. Afterwards, the multi-facility problem is discussed and several discretization results for tree networks are presented for the case that the demand is constant on each edge; unfortunately, these results do not carry over to general networks as a counter example shows. To tackle practical problems, the conditional version of the problem is considered and a greedy heuristic is introduced. Afterwards, numerical tests are presented to underline the practicality of the algorithms proposed and to understand the conditions under which accurate modeling of edge-based demand and a continuous edge-based location space are particularly important.

TI Translating sustainable seafood frameworks to assess the implementation
   of ecosystem-based fisheries management
SO FISHERIES RESEARCH
AB Implementing fisheries management goals that simultaneously consider ecosystem effects of fishing and socioeconomic sustainability is challenging. In recent years, multiple market-based frameworks and guidelines that assess fishery sustainability have been developed, including sustainable seafood recommendation lists and certification schemes. These frameworks use suites of indicators to assess sustainability across fishery types to provide awareness to seafood suppliers, retailers, and consumers. We suggest that these indicators could also be useful to managers to track their own performance. Here we evaluate and compare four of the best-known frameworks available to assess fishery sustainability and consider their potential applicability to fisheries management in California: the Marine Stewardship Council's 2013 certification requirements for fisheries, Friend of the Sea's 2011 certification criteria for wild-caught fisheries, the Seafood Watch program's current criteria for fisheries, and an FAO sustainability checklist combined with the FAO's International Guidelines on Bycatch Management and Reduction of Discards. We assessed the alignment between the indicators used in these frameworks and the goals and requirements of the Marine Life Management Act (MLMA), the primary statute governing fisheries management in California's coastal waters. In general, we found considerable overlap between the biophysical sustainability criteria assessed by these indicators and the requirements of the MLMA, revealing that these indicators align well with practical management needs. While the MLMA is a useful case study, these sustainability indicators could be applied more broadly by other states and federal fisheries managers to concretely evaluate progress towards ecosystem-based management goals. Ultimately, a refined suite of indicators could be operationalized, e.g., via decision trees or questionnaires for fishery managers to assess how well they are meeting ecosystem-based management objectives.

TI A hybrid integrated architecture for energy consumption prediction
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB Irresponsible and negligent use of natural resources in the last five decades has made it an important priority to adopt more intelligent ways of managing existing resources, especially the ones related to energy. The main objective of this paper is to explore the opportunities of integrating internal data already stored in Data Warehouses together with external Big Data to improve energy consumption predictions. This paper presents a study in which we propose an architecture that makes use of already stored energy data and external unstructured information to improve knowledge acquisition and allow managers to make better decisions. This external knowledge is represented by a torrent of information that, in many cases, is hidden across heterogeneous and unstructured data sources, which are recuperated by an Information Extraction system. Alternatively, it is present in social networks expressed as user opinions. Furthermore, our approach applies data mining techniques to exploit the already integrated data. Our approach has been applied to a real case study and shows promising results. The experiments carried out in this work are twofold: (i) using and comparing diverse Artificial Intelligence methods, and (ii) validating our approach with data sources integration.

TI Genie: A new, fast, and outlier-resistant hierarchical clustering
   algorithm
SO INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB The time needed to apply a hierarchical clustering algorithm is most often dominated by the number of computations of a pairwise dissimilarity measure. Such a constraint, for larger data sets, puts at a disadvantage the use of all the classical linkage criteria but the single linkage one. However, it is known that the single linkage clustering algorithm is very sensitive to outliers, produces highly skewed dendrograms, and therefore usually does not reflect the true underlying data structure - unless the clusters are well-separated. To overcome its limitations, we propose a new hierarchical clustering linkage criterion called Genie. Namely, our algorithm links two clusters in such a way that a choseh economic inequity measure (e.g., the Gini- or Bonferroni-index) of the cluster sizes does not increase drastically above a given threshold. The presented benchmarks indicate a high practical usefulness of the introduced method: it most often outperforms the Ward or average linkage in terms of the clustering quality while retaining the single linkage speed. The Genie algorithm is easily parallelizable and thus may be run on multiple threads to speed up its execution further on. Its memory overhead is small: there is no need to precompute the complete distance matrix to perform the computations in order to obtain a desired clustering. It can be applied on arbitrary spaces equipped with a dissimilarity measure, e.g., on real vectors, DNA or protein sequences, images, rankings, informetric data, etc. A reference implementation of the algorithin has been included in the open source genie package for R.

TI A genetic algorithm for topology optimization of area-to-point heat
   conduction problem
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THERMAL SCIENCES
AB This paper presents a way of solving the classical area (volume)-to-point heat conduction problem by the means of a simple Genetic Algorithm (GA) in square configuration. After a short description of the numerical method, the optimal solutions proposed for minimizing the peak or mean temperature of a domain are presented. The effects of the conductivity ratio and the filling ratio on the configurations of the conductive tree are also analyzed and discussed. A numerical benchmark is then established to assess the influence of mesh resolution and the reproducibility of the GA optimization. Results show that GA is capable of proposing solutions having almost the same cooling effectiveness for different mesh resolutions or random seed generators. GA is also relevant compared to other optimization techniques presented here. It can be considered as a simple, easy to adapt and robust but computation time consuming method for addressing the general area (volume)-to-point heat conduction problem.

TI Predicting behavior of FRP-confined concrete using neuro fuzzy, neural
   network, multivariate adaptive regression splines and M5 model tree
   techniques
SO MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES
AB This paper studies the ability of artificial neural network (ANN), adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and M5 Model Tree (M5Tree) techniques to predict ultimate conditions of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP)-confined concrete. A large experimental test database that consists of over 1000 axial compression tests results of FRP-confined concrete specimens assembled from the published literature was used to train, test, and validate the models. The modeling results show that the ANN, ANFIS, MARS and M5Tree models fit well with the experimental test data. The M5Tree model performs better than the remaining models in predicting the hoop strain reduction factor and strength enhancement ratio, whereas the ANN model provided the most accurate estimates of the strain enhancement ratio. Performances of the proposed models are also compared with those of the existing conventional and evolutionary algorithm models, which indicate that the proposed ANN, ANFIS, MARS and M5Tree models exhibit improved accuracy over the existing models. The predictions of each proposed model are subsequently used to establish the interdependence of critical parameters and their influence on the behavior of FRP-confined concrete, which are discussed in the paper.

TI HAZOP analysis based on sensitivity evaluation
SO SAFETY SCIENCE
AB Hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis approach based on sensitivity evaluation is presented in this paper to ensure production safety in complex and large-scale chemical plants. In this approach, the sensitivity evaluation is introduced into HAZOP deviation analysis to measure the effect degree caused by each cause on the corresponding deviation. A quantitative sensitivity evaluation model of deviation cause is first established, in which the departure degree, time duration to reach the maximum deviation, and stability degree of the target process variable are determined as evaluation factors. The sensitivity evaluation of each deviation cause is performed based on the dynamic process simulation. The multiple deviation causes that correspond to the deviation are ranked based on sensitivity index, thereby identifying the significant effect causes on deviation from multiple causes; this identification will assist plant operators and safety management staff on their on-line process monitoring and fault diagnosis. Finally, the proposed approach is applied to the depropanization unit in a gas fractionation plant. The sensitivity evaluation was carried out for 10 deviation causes that correspond to the deviation "higher overhead pressure", in which three and seven sensitive and non-sensitive causes were identified, respectively. The result of the case study demonstrates that the proposed approach can improve the readability and guidance of conventional HAZOP report, which is consistent with the actual production conditions.

TI The bowtie method: A review
SO SAFETY SCIENCE
AB The bowtie method is becoming more popular, but it lacks a consistent approach. This article reviews the available literature and identifies the different approaches that are taken. There are two main types of bowties. Quantitative bowties and Qualitative bowties. Most Quantitative bowties use a fault tree together with an event tree and barriers to calculate risk. The ORM bowtie can also be considered a Quantitative bowtie, although its structure is different from a fault and event tree. Qualitative bowties use simpler cause-effect scenarios with barriers to communicate the risk to an audience. It is proposed to allow these variations of the method to exist and be used when applicable. It is also proposed that people using the bowtie method give an additional qualification as to whether they're using a qualitative or quantitative variant. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI On bandwidth selection using minimal spanning tree for kernel density
   estimation
SO COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS
AB The use of kernel density estimation is quite well known in large variety of machine learning applications like classification, clustering, feature selection, etc. One of the major issues in the construction of kernel density estimators is the tuning of bandwidth parameter. Most of the bandwidth selection procedures optimize mean integrated squared or absolute error, which require huge computational time as the size of the data increases. Here, the bandwidth has been taken to be a function of inter-point distances of the data set. It is defined as a function of the length of Euclidean Minimal Spanning Tree of the given sample points. No rigorous theory about the asymptotic properties of the EMST based density estimator has been developed in the literature. Theoretical analysis of the asymptotic properties of the EMST based density estimator has been established and proved that the estimator is asymptotically unbiased to the original density at its every continuity point. Moreover, theoretical analysis has been provided for general kernel. Experiments are conducted using both synthetic and real-life data sets to compare the performance of the EMST bandwidth to those of conventional cross-validation and plug-in bandwidth selectors. It is found that the EMST based estimator achieves the comparative performance, while being simpler and faster than the conventional estimators. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Soil and hydrological responses to wild pig (Sus scofa) exclusion from
   native and strawberry guava (Psidium cattleianum)-invaded tropical
   montane wet forests
SO GEODERMA
AB The structure and function of many ecosystems are threatened by non-native, invasive plant and animal species. Globally, invasive trees alter interception, evapotranspiration, water use, and throughfall, while wild pigs (Sus scofa) have been introduced and now invade widely ranging ecosystems, with impacts to soil and groundcover, and as a consequence, infiltration, runoff and water quality. In a resource management context, physical, chemical and biological control methods can limit the impact of plants on native biodiversity while fence building and animal removal can limit the effects of non-native ungulates on ecosystems. These expensive treatments have documented biodiversity benefits, but few studies have quantified hydrological effects of such management. Using paired fenced/unfenced runoff plots in native and Psidium cattleianum-invaded Hawaiian tropical montane forests, we examined the independent and interactive effects of strawberry guava (Psidium cattleianum), a highly invasive tree in tropical islands and wild pigs on runoff amount, soil erosion rates and fecal indicator bacteria (FIB). We sampled 18 events spanning a 22 month period, and found that: 1) pigs are less active in invaded forests; 2) higher stem densities in invaded forests were associated with lower soil erosion and runoff rates compared to native forest; 3) reduced canopy cover and greater pig activity in native forests resulted in higher runoff volumes, soil erosion rates, and runoff FIB content; and 4) unfenced plots had more bare soil, less vegetation cover and greater soil FIB (Escherichia coli, total coliforms, enterococci) compared to fenced plots. These results point to the importance of understanding the independent and interactive effects of multiple invaders on watershed function. In this study system, removal of an invasive tree without fencing may actually lead to an increase in disturbance, with impacts to both biodiversity and hydrological properties.

TI Changes in heavy metal extractability from contaminated soils remediated
   with organic waste or biochar
SO GEODERMA
AB The effect of the addition of organic waste or biochar on the extractability of heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn) was assessed in five heavy metal-contaminated soils. The amendments studied were: municipal organic waste compost (MOW), green waste (GW), biochar derived from tree bark (BF) and biochar derived from vine shoots (BS). The amendments were added to the soil at 10% dose. A pH(stat) leaching test was applied to the soils and soil + amendment mixtures to assess the effects of the amendments on the extractable metal concentration at the initial pH and in the 2-12 pH range. MOW increased the DOC content in the mixtures for most soils, whereas the rest of amendments only increased the DOC content for the soil with the lowest DOC value. Moreover, in the mixtures obtained from soils with a low buffering capacity, the amendments increased pH (up to 3 units) and the acid neutralization capacity, thus decreasing the extractability of heavy metals at the initial pH of the mixtures. In a few cases, the amendments further decreased the concentrations of extractable metal due to an increase in the sorption capacity of the mixture, even though the soil had high initial pH and ANC values. MOW and GW generally led to larger decreases in metal extractability in the resulting mixtures than biochar, due to their higher sorption and acid neutralization capacities. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI Legacy soil maps as a covariate in digital soil mapping: A case study
   from Northern Iran
SO GEODERMA
AB Digital soil mapping (DSM) can be used for updating soil surveys. Legacy soil survey maps are often used as a covariate for updating soil surveys because such soil survey maps are logically assumed to contain significant information about the spatial distribution of soil classes. In the present study the usefulness of including conventional soil survey maps as a DSM covariate was investigated. Random forest and multinomial logistic regression models were built using two different covariate sets: covariate set 1 included the legacy soil survey, covariate set 2 excluded the soil survey. Soil Great Groups, Subgroups, and Series taxonomic classes were modeled using both models and covariate sets for an area of 85,000 ha in Golestan Province, northern Iran. Overall model accuracy, the Kappa statistic, and individual covariate importances were used to assess the influence of including the legacy soil survey.
   Including the conventional soil map as covariate generally increased model accuracy, but the improvement in model accuracy was surprisingly small at all taxonomic levels. This may be due to soil change or the mapping scale of the legacy soil survey. Random forests was found to be more accurate than multinomial logistic regression at all taxonomic levels. Multinomial logistic regression models at the soil Series level were less accurate than the legacy soil survey. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   yothersi (McGregor) (Acari: Tetranychidae) affect the emissions of
   herbivore-induced plant volatiles on avocado (Persea americana Mill. cv.
   Hass) shoots under semi-field conditions
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ACAROLOGY
AB Plants attacked by insects and mites release blends of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs), which act as chemical cues that attract predators and/or repel herbivores alongside alerting neighbouring plants. The chemical profiles of avocado (Persea americana Mill. Cultivar Hass) shoots infested with the foliar mite Oligonychus yothersi (Acari: Tetranychidae) were analysed using a gas chromatograph coupled to a mass spectrometer (GC-MS); the different collections of volatiles were performed under semi-field conditions in summer. Four infestation treatments were applied to the avocado shoots (uninfested plant or control; low, medium and high mite-infestation levels). The chemical profiles collected in situ changed qualitatively and quantitatively after infestation, increasing the emissions of (Z)--ocimene, (E)--ocimene, -linalool, -farnesene, farnesyl cyanide and methyl salicylate (MeSA) as opposed to those of the uninfested shoots. The amount of HIPVs emitted by the avocado shoots with the highest O. yothersi population density (250 +/- 10mites per leaf) were greater than those of the shoots infested with the lower population density (60 +/- 10mites per leaf); to the emissions of (E)--ocimene, sesquiterpenes and MeSA at higher amounts even after seventeen days of continuous infestation. Likewise, the emissions of HIPVs increased with each infestation level; also fluctuating between collecting dates, which indicates that environmental conditions maximized or constrained those emissions. In addition, the damaged foliar area increased with higher O. yothersi population densities after seventeen days of infestation. These results indicate that higher mite-population densities and continuous O. yothersi-feeding increases the amounts of HIPVs emitted by O. yothersi-infested shoots in summer.

TI Soil polygon disaggregation through similarity-based prediction with
   legacy pedons
SO JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
AB Conventional soil maps generally contain one or more soil types within a single soil polygon. But their geographic locations within the polygon are not specified. This restricts current applications of the maps in site-specific agricultural management and environmental modelling. We examined the utility of legacy pedon data for disaggregating soil polygons and the effectiveness of similarity-based prediction for making use of the under- or over-sampled legacy pedon data for the disaggregation. The method consisted of three steps. First, environmental similarities between the pedon sites and each location were computed based on soil formative environmental factors. Second, according to soil types of the pedon sites, the similarities were aggregated to derive similarity distribution for each soil type. Third, a hardening process was performed on the maps to allocate candidate soil types within the polygons. The study was conducted at the soil subgroup level in a semi-arid area situated in Manitoba, Canada. Based on 186 independent pedon sites, the evaluation of the disaggregated map of soil subgroups showed an overall accuracy of 67% and a Kappa statistic of 0.62. The map represented a better spatial pattern of soil subgroups in both detail and accuracy compared to a dominant soil subgroup map, which was commonly used in practice. Incorrect predictions mainly occurred in the agricultural plain area and the soil subgroups that are very similar in taxonomy, indicating that new environmental covariates need to be developed. We concluded that the combination of legacy pedon data with similarity-based prediction is an effective solution for soil polygon disaggregation.

TI Edge-disjoint rainbow spanning trees in complete graphs
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF COMBINATORICS
AB Let G be an edge-colored copy of K-n, where each color appears on at most n/2 edges (the edge-coloring is not necessarily proper). A rainbow spanning tree is a spanning tree of G where each edge has a different color. Brualdi and Hollingsworth (1996) conjectured that every properly edge-colored K-n (n >= 6 and even) using exactly n-1 colors has n/2 edge-disjoint rainbow spanning trees, and they proved there are at least two edge-disjoint rainbow spanning trees. Kaneko et al. (2003) strengthened the conjecture to include any proper edge-coloring of K-n, and they proved there are at least three edge-disjoint rainbow spanning trees. Akbari and Alipour (2007) showed that each K-n that is edge-colored such that no color appears more than n/2 times contains at least two rainbow spanning trees.
   We prove that if n >= 1,000,000, then an edge-colored K-n, where each color appears on at most n/2 edges, contains at least [n/(1000 log n)] edge-disjoint rainbow spanning trees. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI A practical methodology to optimise marginal mineral deposits using
   switching real options
SO ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS
AB Currently depressed commodity prices have rendered many mining projects marginal irrespective of their geological merit. Tight capital markets discourage investment in their development because of their unappealing deterministic NPVs, which in the majority of cases reflect conceptual designs focused on achieving primarily economies of scale often at the expenses of operating flexibility. Given that project profits and cash flows are highly sensitive to movements in volatile commodity prices, circumstances now call for a re-direction of emphasis towards creating managerial flexibility to facilitate and minimize the cost of temporarily placing projects in care and maintenance and re-opening them in response to increases in prices. This flexibility, that is to say the option to alternatively switch the project between an open and closed state, can be created through an appropriate combination of mine design, commercial procurement arrangements and mode of operations that enables managers to anticipate and take advantage of future hikes in prices, while minimizing the negative effect of downturns. This paper presents a practical example of how to estimate the real option value (ROV) of this type of switching option, which is generally not captured by the deterministic DCF/NPV of projects. To facilitate the numerical presentation, initially the binomial lattice method is applied only to the first 2 years of a realistic DCF model of a gold mine, with an expected life of 5 years and a negative deterministic NPV. The model is limited to assessing the ROV created by introducing switching flexibility as a result of the volatility of the gold price in isolation. A consistent ROV is then obtained using as an alternative the unrelated decision tree methodology. This result is considered important as using decision trees for this type of analyses in cases where more than one source of uncertainty is involved (e.g. that of grades, costs, and exchange rates) does not require, as in the case of binomial lattices, estimating the volatility of a project cash flow. This process, which may create computational ambiguity and possible bias, can be avoided in decision trees as each source of uncertainty is represented by an individual event node. Finally the ROV of the project, including the switching option, is calculated over its whole 5-year life to provide some indication of the amount that could justifiably be invested up-front to create the necessary switching flexibility.

TI A multi-objective approach towards cost effective isolated handwritten
   Bangla character and digit recognition
SO PATTERN RECOGNITION
AB Identifying the most informative local regions of a handwritten character image is necessary for a robust handwritten character recognition system. But identifying them from a character image is a difficult task. If this task were to be performed incurring minimum possible cost, it becomes more challenging due to having two independent, apparently contradicting objectives which need to be optimized simultaneously, i.e. maximizing the recognition accuracy and minimizing the associated recognition cost. To address the problem a multi-objective approach is required. In the present task, two popular multi objective optimization Algorithm (1) a Non-Dominated Sorting Harmony-Search Algorithm (NSHA) and (2) a Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-Il, Deb et al., 2002 [18]) are employed for region sampling separately. The method objectively selects the most informative set of local regions using the framework of Axiomatic Fuzzy Set (AFS) theory, from the sets of pareto-optimal solutions provided by the multi-objective region sampling algorithms. The system has been evaluated on two isolated handwritten Bangla datasets, (1) a dataset of randomly mixed handwritten Bangla Basic and Compound characters and (2) a dataset of handwritten Bangla numerals separately, with SVM based classifier, using a feature set containing convex-hull based features and CG based quad-tree partitioned longest-run based local features extracted from the selected local regions. The results have shown a significant increase in recognition accuracy and decrease in recognition cost for all the datasets. Thus the present system introduces a cost effective approach towards isolated handwritten character recognition systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Small dim object tracking using frequency and spatial domain information
SO PATTERN RECOGNITION
AB Small dim target tracking is an active and important research area in image processing and pattern recognition. Recently, there has been an emphasis on the development of algorithms based on spatial domain Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) detection. This paper presents a novel algorithm for detecting and tracking small dim targets in Infrared (IR) image sequences with low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) based on the frequency and spatial domain information. Using a Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DT-CWT), a CFAR detector is applied in the frequency domain to find potential positions of objects in a frame. Following this step, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification is applied to accept or reject each potential point based on the spatial domain information of the frame. The combination of the frequency and spatial domain information demonstrates the high efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method which is supported by the experimental results.

TI Microclimate, development and productivity of robusta coffee shaded by
   rubber trees and at full sun
SO REVISTA CIENCIA AGRONOMICA
AB There are few studies about the shading of Robusta coffee with rubber trees. The aim of this study was evaluate the microclimate, development and yield of Coffea canephora grown at full sun and shaded by rubber trees. The experiment consisted of a Robusta coffee crop (Coffea canephora) grown at under full sun and another coffee crop intercropped with rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis). The rubber trees and coffee crop were planted in the East/West direction, in Jaguare, Espirito Santo, Brazil. Was evaluated the luminosity, temperature and relative humidity, leaf nutrient concentrations; internodes of the plagiotropic and orthotropic branches, leaf area; relative chlorophyll index, and tree yield of the coffee crops. The shading directly influenced the microclimate by reducing the air temperature in the summer and winter, as well as by increasing relative humidity. Luminosity in the summer had an average decrease of 905 lumens ft(-2) throughout the day, which was equivalent to 72.49%, and luminosity in the winter had an average decrease of 1665 lumens ft(-2), which was equivalent to 88.04%. The shading provided greater etiolation of the plagiotropic and orthotropic branches as well as greater leaf expansion as compared to the full sun. The leaf concentration of Fe and Mn were higher in the shaded coffee. Estimated chlorophyll b and total chlorophyll were greater in the coffee crop grown at under full sun. The dense shading produced by rubber trees provided losses in the coffee crop yield, however, there is the formation of the rubber tree.

TI Fractionation and some physicochemical properties of almond gum
   (Amygdalus communis L.) exudates
SO FOOD HYDROCOLLOIDS
AB Compositions of both soluble and insoluble fractions of gum exudates from the trunk and branches of sweet almond tree (Amygdalus communis L.) were investigated. Monosaccharide analysis by HPLC indicated the presence of galactose and arabinose as the main sugars. FTIR spectra showed no significant differences between the functional groups of the whole gum and those of its fractions. Furthermore, only the intensity of OH and amide bond in the insoluble fraction was found to be higher than those of the soluble fraction and whole gum. XRD analysis revealed the amorphous structures of the whole gum and its fractions. Higher crystallinity index and crystalline size were observed in the insoluble fraction than in either the whole gum or the soluble fraction. TGA analysis revealed that the thermal decomposition of almond gum and its fractions occurred at around 250-260 degrees C. Finally, GPC analysis showed that the insoluble fraction had a higher molecular weight than did the whole gum or its soluble fraction. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Genuine non-congruence subgroups of Drinfeld modular groups

AB Let A be the ring of elements in an algebraic function field K over a finite field F-q which are integral outside a fixed place infinity. In an earlier paper we have shown that the Drinfeld modular group G = GL(2)(A) has automorphisms which map congruence subgroups to non-congruence subgroups. Here we prove the existence of (uncountably many) normal genuine non-congruence subgroups, defined to be those which remain non-congruence under the action of every automorphism of G. In addition, for all but finitely many cases we evaluate ngncs(G), the smallest index of a normal genuine non-congruence subgroup of G, and compare it to the minimal index of an arbitrary normal non-congruence subgroup.

If the order of v is not divisible by the characteristic of k, this algebra is isomorphic to the Hochschild cohomology algebra of R. We prove that this algebra is a BV algebra. Moreover, we construct a BV differential on it in a canonical way. We use this fact to calculate the Gerstenhaber algebra structure and a BV structure on the Hochschild cohomology algebras of a family of self-injective algebras of tree type D-n.

TI Hierarchical outcomes and collusion neutrality on networks
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH
AB We investigate TU-game solutions that are neutral to collusive agreements among players. A collusive agreement binds collusion members to act as a single player and is feasible when they are connected on a network. Collusion neutrality requires that no feasible collusive agreement can change the total payoff of collusion members. We show that on the domain of network games, there is a solution satisfying collusion neutrality, efficiency and null-player property if and only if the network is a tree. Considering a tree network, we show that affine combinations of hierarchical outcomes (Demange, 2004; van den Brink, 2012) are the only solutions satisfying the three axioms together with linearity. As corollaries, we establish characterizations of the average tree solution (equally weighted average of hierarchical outcomes); one established earlier in the literature and the others new.

Moreover, we suppose that the obstacles are right continuous and left limited (ROLL) processes with predictable and totally inaccessible jumps and satisfy Mokobodzki's condition. Our main contribution consists in the construction of an implementable numerical scheme, based on two random binomial trees and the penalization method, which is shown to converge to the solution of the DBBSDE. Finally, we illustrate the theoretical results with some numerical examples in the case of general jumps. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Ensemble boosted trees with synthetic features generation in application
   to bankruptcy prediction
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB Bankruptcy prediction has been a subject of interests for almost a century and it still ranks high among hottest topics in economics. The aim of predicting financial distress is to develop a predictive model that combines various econometric measures and allows to foresee a financial condition of a firm. In this domain various methods were proposed that were based on statistical hypothesis testing, statistical modeling (e.g., generalized linear models), and recently artificial intelligence (e.g., neural networks, Support Vector Machines, decision tress). In this paper, we propose a novel approach for bankruptcy prediction that utilizes Extreme Gradient Boosting for learning an ensemble of decision trees. Additionally, in order to reflect higher-order statistics in data and impose a prior knowledge about data representation, we introduce a new concept that we refer as to synthetic features. A synthetic feature is a combination of the econometric measures using arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). Each synthetic feature can be seen as a single regression model that is developed in an evolutionary manner. We evaluate our solution using the collected data about Polish companies in five tasks corresponding to the bankruptcy prediction in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th year. We compare our approach with the reference methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Data-mining model based adaptive protection scheme to enhance distance
   relay performance during power swing
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS
AB The paper presents a data-mining model based adaptive protection scheme enhancing distance relay performance during power swing for both compensated and uncompensated power transmission networks. In the power transmission network, the distance relays are sensitive to certain system event such as power swings, which drive the apparent impedance trajectories into the protection zones of the distance relay (zone-3) causing mal-operation of the distance relay, leading to subsequent blackouts. Further, three-phase balanced symmetrical fault detection during power swing is one of the serious concerns for the distance relay operation. This paper proposed a new adaptive protection scheme method based on data-mining models such as DT (decision tree) and RF (random forests) for providing supervisory control to the operation of the conventional distance relays. The proposed scheme is able to distinguish power swings and faults during power swing including fault zone identification for series compensated power transmission network during stress condition like power swing. The proposed scheme has been validated on a 39-bus New England system which is developed on Dig-Silent power factory commercial software (PF4C) platform and the performance indicate that the proposed scheme can reliably enhance the distance relay operation during power swing.

TI Distributed adaptive pinning control for cluster synchronization of

SO COMMUNICATIONS IN NONLINEAR SCIENCE AND NUMERICAL SIMULATION
AB This paper is devoted to the cluster synchronization issue of nonlinearly coupled Lur'e networks under the distributed adaptive pinning control strategy. The time-varying delayed networks consisted of identical and nonidentical Lur'e systems are discussed respectively by applying the edge-based pinning control scheme. In each cluster, the edges belonging to the spanning tree are pinned. In view of the nonlinearly couplings of the networks, for the first time, an efficient distributed nonlinearly adaptive update law based on the local information of the dynamical behaviors of node is proposed. Sufficient criteria for the achievement of cluster synchronization are derived based on S-procedure, Kronecker product and Lyapunov stability theory. Additionally, some illustrative examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The maximal intervals of Pi(w)(n) provide a generalization of the lattice Pi(n) of partitions, which we show possesses many of the well-known properties of Pi(n). In particular, we prove these intervals are EL-shellable, we show that the Mobius invariant of each maximal interval is given up to sign by the number of rooted trees on node set {1, 2,..., n} having a fixed number of descents, we find combinatorial bases for homology and cohomology, and we give an explicit sign twisted S-n-module isomorphism from cohomology to the multilinear component of the free Lie algebra with two compatible brackets. We also show that the characteristic polynomial of Pi(w)(n) has a nice factorization analogous to that of Pi(n).
